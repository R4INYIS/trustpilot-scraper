I would not recommend Paystream,"I would not recommend Paystream, this is the second time and probably not the last time they are making the same mistakes when it comes to my expenses despite being given every information under the sun for them to complete the process properly. Because of their incompetence I‚Äôve had to wait over a month each time to get my expenses reimbursed. And yet again I am having the same issue. No one in the finance department seems to know what they are doing. They keep asking for the same information that they I‚Äôve clearly uploaded to their own portal. It‚Äôs obvious they aren‚Äôt even looking at it. It's so exhausting speaking to them. The worst part is I‚Äôm still being charged for this substandard service. Once my expenses situation is sorted I will be moving to another company, who hopefully unlike PayStream know what they are actually doing.",1,Date of experience: 04 September 2024,18 Sept 2024

They simply don't care,Thank you for your lengthy response but I genuinely still believe that there is a bit more that could have easily been done. I have been contracting with your company for 18 months and my payments were steady. It was obvious that I would most likely be over the HMRC threshold for the tax code your were using and if you were unsure a simple conversation with me would have suffice. I have never been in this situation with any previous employers and I hope there will be lessons learned on your side from this experience. I still believe you could have done a better job to be honest if you did really care as you say you do! Still not a great experience for me and won't be working with you again in the future that's for sure!,1,Date of experience: 13 September 2024,Updated 16 Sept 2024
"Too many invoicing errors, avoid!","I've been with Paystream for three years now for my Limited company. Up until this year, they have been great, however over recent months the service I have received has degraded. This is primarily to do with invoicing errors - I have more than one contract so that means different invoices need to be sent out to my clients. Unfortunately Paystream have been issuing the wrong invoices, to the point where one client received an invoice that should have been sent to another client, which of course revealed the rates I was chargingthat client.The really annoying thing about this whole situation is that I send Paystream a timesheet for each invoice I want them to generate - this timesheet contains the client to invoice, the number of hours/days I have completed and the amount to invoice. It makes me wonder if the people generating the invoice actually read the paperwork you send them - I think not!Unfortunately I'm now at the point where I no longer trust Paystream to handle my accounts - I'm in the process of moving to another accountant. As you can imagine, these errors are embarrasing for me. I have a reputation to maintain with my clients - it just makes me look totally incompetent with simple invoicing. I am trying to run a business which means supporting my clients - the last thing I need is the headache of an accountant that cannot get the basics right.Anyway, a sad ending when things used to be so good.",1,Date of experience: 25 September 2024,25 Sept 2024

Please catch-up PayStream,"A simple to use online platform, although I do question why I can‚Äôt simply submit an excel like I have with other companies.

It‚Äôs all getting a bit messy. PLEASE CATCHUP PAYSTREAM. UPDATE 26 July - that‚Äôs another month processed without any tax relief. Now over 2 months behind.

PayStream got on my last nerve!!!,"Quite frankly PayStream were frustrating, upsetting and got on my last nerve. I used PayStream between Autumn 2021 and Summer 2024..We've had a few issues when I have changed roles and/or when PayStream themselves changed my product with them a few times without telling me, which resulting in HMRC changing my tax code in the belief I had more than one role.   But in April 2024 PayStream began to deal with my rail expenses differently and held my expense funds despite me having to claim these via my timesheet, which was approved by my line manager inorder to released the funds to PayStream.  I then had to claim my expenses again via PayStream portal, essentially providing all information and receipts twice.  PayStream then asked for a rail ticket receipt with the name of the traveller plus the start and end destinations, the rail receipt I had from the rail station ticket office does not have this information.  This was also  strange when I have not been asked to provide nor have I ever provided this in the past. PayStream then paid the rail parking element of the expense claim, which shows the date and time I arrived (clear evidence of where my journey began),d displayed my car reg (most likely to be me driving) plus the duration of my stay in the car park.In my attempts to resolve the Rail Ticket expenses PayStream then asked me to provide an explanation for my journey and whom else was in attendance at the meetings to which I travelled - quite frankly they were frustrating, upsetting and got on my last nerve. PayStream's inability to deal and the issue saw me request that all unpaid expenses were returned to my agency and I found a new umbrella provider.My new provider have been amazing and resolved the outstanding expenses without me having to do a single thing.",1,Date of experience: 29 April 2024,6 Jul 2024

Not only were they very slow, but I eventually had to threaten PayStream with legal action in order for them to confirm that I was indeed a permanent employee. Anyway, I decided not to change umbrella companies as switching itself is somewhat painful; and how much trouble could they really cause?Fast forward to today and again I needed a reference for a tenancy application. Have things improved at all? Absolutely not! Not only did PayStream fail to confirm that I was a permanent employee as I explicitly asked for, but they made several critical mistakes, including that I had left and returned to PayStream when in fact I had only changed end clients. (Does an umbrella company help with continuity of employment? Not with these clowns!)So again my tenancy application has been jeopardised by PayStream.

Avoid this umbrella if you don't want to get soaked financially!!,"UPDATE: The response from paystream is total nonsense. They tried to reach out to me with false claims (same as below) and when I asked to speak to their accountants to go through the salary sacrifice and link from Royal London I had sent them on salary sacrifice, they did not contact me. Instead they replied with total BS and smokes and mirrors response here. they DO NOT pass on NI savings they gain from salary sacrifice. Contractors should google Royal London salary sacrifice NI contributions to understand. The reduction in ""net income"" is standard in either case - whether they pass on the NI savings or not (explained in royal london link) - Something which paystream has not addressed or explained to me. Contractors beware of this company you will be ripped off. You can just check with other umbrella company and ask for figures with and without 13.8% NI savings. You will find paystream do not pass it on when you look at the figures.I was with them for the best part of 18 months. I would say avoid them as I transferred to another due to following reasons and it turned out to be an eye opener, so I thought  I will write this review! All umbrella companies are unregulated effectively so they can get away with anything really unless you are careful and check things carefully. - Customer service is OK but its like call centre so you might not always get best advice depending on the knowledge of the person dealing with your query. I had many cases where it took more than 1 person to give a proper explanation. The initial ""illustration"" they will give you (almost of true of others too) will be much higher figure than what you will actually receive after their fees and various deductions. So don't look at the these ""illustrations"" and sign up!- They charge high fees and they will increase these ""fees"" -  even on ""salary sacrifice"" which are YOUR pension contributions as ""admin fee"" - even though nothing in admin changes! So that is additional tax effectively you end up paying to this company for saving into your own pension.- If you are inside IR35 you will be given ""employers NI contributions"" as part of your invoice by your client. Now any ""employer"" (i.e this umbrella company who is your employer) will get a saving of about 13.8% (google it) on YOUR pension contributions/salary sacrifice on the employers NI. They keep this saving and the company does not pass it onto the contractors. This could be a huge amount depending on how much you are sacrificing into your pension each day/week/month! They are pocketing this saving. There are other umbrella companies who will pass on this saving onto your pension contribution rather than pocketing it themselves! This could be a very large amount. Your pension contribution to your provider should be higher than what you contribute if they were passing on the savings to you! It is simple as that. Don't fall for anything else they tell you about ""gross"" and ""net"" deductions blah blah.Also, they will not mention pension admin charges or anything about the above to you when you sign up! - I think they also pay the end agencies higher payments so agencies tend to recommend them. More often than not big agencies try to steer you towards this company as opposed to other smaller umbrella companies. I think this is because of the commission or kickbacks or whatever they make from this company which could all be part of a very complex agreement between them.UPDATE: All my details have been provided to trustpilot to verify.",1,Date of experience: 05 April 2024,Updated 1 May 2024

Complete disaster in every respect,"Where do I start, so much was and still is very bad, would be best if you also read the hundreds of 1 star reviews for the overall picture, I can say that virtually every header there dictates exactly what occured, and is still ongoing, do not listen to promises of correction, it never happens, all they do is put the blame back on you and be excessively defensive on every issue.  With myself, firstly the cheerfull on boarding person said that all the other umbrellas I contacted had the worng estimates and didnt know what they were doing, so off I went with the higher amount due from them, which, of course came back to bite me hard.  They advised that the responsibility for the amount of tax paid is mine and not theirs, and that they are not accountants, and not responsible.  They said I never gave them my previous emplyer P45 and P60, I did, they never changed the tax code from BR, so you would have thought I was due a refund... afraid not the calculations were so bad this was all used up by HMRC.They said that the luxury of having not paid the correct tax was a benifit and gave me good cash flow..  how odd is that ?  HMRC has a warning on my gateway advising that Paystream have not provided them with the information required, since April 23, this remains.  So on top of the fact that my taxcode is now K650. there are other issues.   Weekly, I had to call in, issues with payment, the agency was pulling their hair out, many times I never got paid on time.  Support, a joke, after a week someone may get back saying it will take longer, when in fact, it was in hand by someone else in the office, zero co ordination. More ?  expenses, they taxed the entire value without even asking for any clarification, and me having been told that this was due to me not giving them currency exchange rate, some thing a senior manager (now involved) refuted, needless to say, with so much hot air, they refunded at 6pm on a Friday, panic must have set in..  and theres much more, but read the other 1 star reviews, they are all listed.So, dont get taken back by the jolly front end high pressure sales team, its all a front, similarily, dont beleive any response, including the one this will generate, nothing ever happens.  Best advice, just dont use them, ever.Update:As per the expected response below from Paystream..  not only have they even bothered to look at my response email, they have ignored everything and even removed sections from the email.  Just to re iterate :1. They were given my P45 and P60 from my previous employee on joining, in fact, it was a requirement..2. They never, and still havent, been in contact with HMRC, I even have a warning as such on my gateway.3. Their direct actions, or indeed lack of them... have caused me to have a tax code of K6504. Citing the fact that an erronous calculation was good for me so I could excercise a larger cashflow is pretty pathetic, and omitted from their canned response",1,Date of experience: 12 April 2024,Updated 19 Apr 2024

Paystream are *still* incompetent and uncaring.,"*Update.  After a few more weeks of to-ing and fro-ing there have been a couple of, what appeared to be, helpful interactions but nothing that has resulted in my actually being paid accurately or on time. It's just so tedious and time consuming Paystream are incompetent and uncaring.They will move heaven and earth to ensure that genuine mileage claims are paid through PAYE. I suspect (don't know for sure) this is because they do not want to deal with the overhead of dealing with HMRC enquiries on such claims. They have made errors on the majority of my timesheets that are always in their favour.They also increase charges without telling you.I've come to dread my weekly calls  to them to fix errors or explain another unexpected cost.Dealing with them is stressful and anxiety inducing. I have resigned myself to having to suck it up until the end of my current contract, when I can switch umbrellas and be done with them.Well done PayStream. You beat me into submission.

Payroll normally goes OK but there are issues,"Payroll normally goes OK, you get paid usually 2-3 weeks after the client has paid, minus the 50 odd percent tax of course.Setting up a private pension contribution takes forever, in my case about 6 months so I lost a significant contribution to my pension  and associated tax relief.They also have constraints around pensions in that you can't make a fixed contribution each month, neither can you make a lump sum contribution. Lots of red tape and explanations are needed to do anything in this area despite it being YOUR money. Expenses are a problem and not easy to get paid out.Think of Paystream as an agent for HMRC simply there to collect tax but offer you little support. They are your 'employer' only when it suits them - auto enrolling you in their pension scheme and trying to withold holiday pay etc.The madness of IR35 means you pay somebody to 'employ' you and treat you like a young child. Two stars for the payroll, very little else to recommend here other than the staff are friendly, if ineffective. I will be leaving (or should that be 'resigning') very soon...*****EDIT JAN 24******I have been in touch with a dedicated team leader who is helping to resolve issues discussed above and looking at ways to improve the immediate situation and evolve other aspects.

Bad experience,It seems most people are happy with Paystream but i have had a horrible experience . My payment was missed on a Friday due to late approval of my timesheet . It then resulted in me getting paid twice the following week. When i got paid that following week i noted  my  payment was short of 300 pounds. When I wrote to them they simply replied that i should contact HMRC to change my tax code which does not make sense .The issue is purely administrative . Someone should have understood that i was getting paid twice because a payment had been missed the previous week and do the adjustment . Paystream was very unhelpful. And will not be able to recommend them .It may be that the team are with are not as professional as others,3,Date of experience: 24 July 2023,24 Nov 2023

So  many errors causing grief and checking,"So  many errors causing grief and resulting in having to check up on these guys all the time. I'm not an accountant but have learnt a lot because of all the mistakes they've made... 1) incorrect VAT submitted - but when updated HMRC was still chasing for larger amount which cause no end of grief and letters from HMRC threatening action2) penalty from HMRC for above which I had to make a  case for Paystream to pay... ie they didn't offer any recompense for inconvenience caused and didn't offer to pay for penalty. It was small but it was the principle.3) incorrect advice about taking money out of company at end of tax year which resulted in ¬£3000+ more in personal tax etc...and company tax4) when closing, incorrect advice about dividends to take out, which I checked and reconfirmed (my calculations were right). Hopefully the right amount was taken in the end.5) when closing, the paystream tax department didn't correctly inform payroll about additional salary week which resulted in issues when the final accounts were made (I had to pay it back )6) when closing, incorrect pension contribution amount suggested which I had to query. There was a 50% discrepancy between their suggestion and what I thought would be the contribution7) Final closing documents sent with request to sign and no discussion about the numbers. When I looked at the numbers they didn't match my bank account balance and surprisingly there was a loss declared, etc... this resulted in a full review of my accounts and quite a few discussions. In the end the books were balanced. 8) no real apologies for having to spend so much time checking up on them and correcting mistakes and no offer of recompense for such sloppy closing processes and advice. As far as I'm concerned, I've been doing most of the work. These are my complaints to date and the closing is not quite completed yet. (it take a while)I am giving two stars and not one or none only because they answer all emails and you don't have to chase (they are nice as well which makes this review hard to write) and also because for my simple accounting requirements they had a good accounting software system.

Don't Use This Company,I am not sure why Pay Stream has been voted one of the best Umbrella companies in the UK. The service is appalling. Nobody is able to help with a simple query on expenses.

Dreadful - go elsewhere!,"I have had so many issues, but I will mention the most important first, so others are not caught out!!If you are (or may in the future be) getting paid monthly use a different umbrella company! PayStream charge a fixed amount for weekly pay and for monthly pay. Monthly charges are 4xweekly charges, however, if you only work 1 day in a month (because you go on holiday or your contract ends day after previous months pay), then you will be charged the full amount (margin and admin fee)! This is the email I got from them when I complained:'As previously advised our margin is dependent on your pay frequency and not the number of days worked. Therefore if your final payment was for one week worked then, as you are paid monthly, we would apply the monthly margin and admin fee.'At the time of the complaint and the above email response, my situation was that my contract was due to finish 1 week into the next monthly pay (with 1BH in the week, i.e. 4days work). Monthly margin charge = ¬£96 + monthly admin fee = ¬£24 (Total ¬£120). Had I been paid weekly it would have been ¬£24 + ¬£6 (Total ¬£30). I had so many other issues, they keep making mistakes on all sorts of things, for example (in the last year):1. Putting through non-taxable expenses as taxable, despite forewarning them, completing a Paystream questionnaire and getting an email acknowledgement back.2. Making a payment into my pension, when I asked them to stop (as I had reached the max limit).3. Making a payment into my pension, because they got the wrong number of days worked!4. Not sending forms through to pension company when making a payment, so that payment then went missing! Took a lot of my time and effort to resolve this (albeit with the pension company) - but had PaySteam done their job properly...!5. Hiding the apprenticeship levy charge (all umbrella's charge this), but PayStream hid the charges for the first 6 years. My original quote I had from them makes no mention of this charge.6. Never informing me of increase in margin charges.7. Margin charges vary depending on the recruitment agency (not sure any other umbrella's do this) - seems like a convenient way to suddenly increase your charges.I asked them to pay me compensation for all the time I wasted chasing to get things corrected, did not receive a penny from them! I am now with another umbrella company.An update wrt PayStream's response: My contract got extended by a few weeks, so yes I was not charged ¬£120 for 4 days; but the point is, I would have been had it not been extended and this was confirmed in an email to me by PayStream (quote above). Yes, everything was resolved, but as I said above, it took a lot of my time chasing up and PayStream did not provide any compensation.",1,Date of experience: 13 June 2023,Updated 10 Jul 2023

UNDERPAID AND NO ACCOUNTABILITY TAKEN FOR MESSING PEOPLES PAY! AVOID COMPANIES LIKE THIS!!,"I‚Äôm giving this company 1 stars, even because in the beginning they were ok and paid me consistently instead of having to wait until 6pm to get paid. Towards the last two weeks of me getting paid from them. They caused me problems. I literally got paid ¬£360 for a 5 day working week where I should have got ¬£440 so was missing around ¬£80. They deducted 4 x student loan payments, doubled my tax and NI etc, leaving me with less pay. This is unacceptable and considering they couldn‚Äôt even take ownership of the error made, no apology and even though I got my tax back I am still minus on the overpayment of student loan. They know I have contacted the Hmrc and student loans line, and aware they I‚Äôve been advised by both they paystream have broken the conduct as they still haven‚Äôt refunded me the money. So I have been passed from pillar to post and paystream keep saying that the ¬£52 as opposed to ¬£11 for my student loan is current. The initial agency messed up big time as they have done before with another umbrella company are originally at fault but I was no longer Liaising with them as I know I was leaving both agency and umbrella companies due to the constant issues and loss of pay. Quite honestly I never want to be under an umbrella company ever again because they take so much money from you, and cause problems which they don‚Äôt take responsibility for nor do they fight for employees which is a big let down. After speaking to someone called Tom from paystream who was a senior person, he said the same nonsense to me. And fobbed me off like Hmrc. So in a nutshell I‚Äôm still owed money which I have every right to by law, and not one single person is bothered to sort it out or refund me my money! So now I will take it further what paystream has done. Constant issues is causing me unnecessary stress and anxiety. And I had advised paystream of issues I had with umbrella.Co.uk company, so these people are no better. They take multiple payments and don‚Äôt fight for you. My advice is simply stay away from these umbrella companies as they will eat your hard earned money and they don‚Äôt deserve it. I am not working my butt off 5 days a week for nothing to get penalised. It‚Äôs unacceptable and disgusting!!",1,Date of experience: 23 June 2023,24 Jun 2023

Client data security is poor,"In my opinion and based on my experience I would stay clear of using this umbrella  even if they are on preferred supplier lists. In my experience this umbrella compromised my personal data, whether this is due to ignorance or incompetence remains unclear.  However I am veering towards the incompetence/ineptitude route as when I raised a formal complaint they asked me to send my date of birth and other personal data over non secure email in order for them to investigate a data breach.  I believe the irony was completely lost on them. I decided to leave Paystream and asked them to send my P45 encrypted or password protected.  They completely ignored my request and sent via non secure email, exposing more of my personal data to attack and potentially to be used for identity theft and fraudulent activities.

Very Difficult to Work With,"I don't like writing bad reviews but if I save someone else the headaches I have had, then it is worth it. Firstly, when it comes to pension payments which are deducted from my salary, it makes sense to calculate these to be as tax efficient as possible. At the start of the tax year, I asked for a figure to be taken from my salary based on my expectations for work for the next 12 months. Towards the end of the tax year, the figure needs to be tweaked so that taxable salary comes in below a certain threshold. When I asked PayStream to adjust the amount, they refused unless I can justify a ""significant life change"". You have to beg with some graduate on a mailbox support (who never supplies their full name) for them to adjust how they process YOUR money and which they then take a fee for. They are under some delusion that they're an actual employer as opposed to an umbrella that charges a fee for a (poor) service.Secondly, on expenses, they have rules which do not align with HMRC. If you want to claim for mileage which the client is happy to reimburse, you have to jump through hoops of submitting the expense in multiple places and then PayStream ask for a receipt and a copy of the V5 document (not required at all)! Every little thing is a pain and that is the reason I have decided to switch. Save yourself some frustration and look elsewhere.",1,Date of experience: 26 May 2023,26 May 2023

The problem is this comes at a cost to the employee; routing your salary or pay package in this way doesn't benefit the employee in anyway, it just costs the employee as he has to now pay for payroll - something which is conventionally a cost incurred by the operating business. I asked Paystream ""what the benefit would be for contractors opting to go through umbrella"" ;- they explained: ""in the case that you need a historical record for a mortgage application, you have that continuous record of employment through paystream."" This is a fair but weak answer for such a high cost.  I rang them to understand the fees and why I only recieved approximately half of the money I invoiced ;- the following was explained. Paystream FeesPaystream charge a fixed weekly fee for their payroll services, ¬£22 irregardless of how much you are paid. One week I earned ¬£72 for the week - umbrella charged ¬£22 out of the ¬£72. I was paid ¬£39 in total after all deductions. Charges You also pay an added employers national insurance and apprenticeship levy which is added in addition to your income tax and personal national insurance.The reasons or law surrounding this is unclear and they do not provide any further information. Paystream does not benefit contractors, particularly contractors that work through an agency. I will never work through Paystream again. If you want your salary sliced to pieces do not work with Paystream. Paystream told me that salaries were calculated with consideration to the money that would be deducted under umbrella, but I find this not to be true. I have earned more on contracts outside of Paystream than I ever have on contracts with Paystream. I see no uplift and I have worked on more than 9 contracts since April  2022. I don't know who to hold primarily responsible, the agencies like epiq and paralaw or Paystream themselves but what I do know is that will be my last contract with Paystream.All that being said, Paystream are very efficient. Paystream make payments on time and provided excellent customer service. As an organisation they are a well oiled machine and if it suits you and your circumstances then that is fine. It didn't suit me and I didn't realise until it was too late.",1,Date of experience: 10 March 2023,Updated 6 Apr 2023

Inconsistent Pay and Poor Reasoning,"Started a new contract, in October and had to find an umbrella company. I had 5 pay runs1 22%2 39%3 24%4 35%5 40%The issue was the inconsistency in pay, unable to budget from one month to the next. Payslip confusion that made no logical sense and has these silly bubbles all over it that tell you nothing. Yesterday I phoned up so they could explain, no reasonable or plausible explanation. Something about an apprentice fund? and deductions that made no sense. They just wanted me off the phone.  Will be following up with a complaint. My other concern is what risk have they exposed me to with HMRC?? They get one star for sending my P45 really quickly, even though it was the second time I told them I was leaving. I would avoid, these companies need better regulating. I would not recommendThey returned my call from this review and still could not give a clear explanation. I would not trust them.

33% increase in margin (per payslip) cost,"Got an email at the beginning of the month saying they are increasing the margin (cost per payslip) from ¬£17 to ¬£23, that‚Äôs a 33% increase and totally unjustifiable in my eyes.  I emailed them words to that affect to receive a non apologetic lengthy response about the use of the margin to cover staffing, IT costs, processing fees, property overheads and bank charges‚Ä¶..amongst other things.  Absolutely no attempt to appease or keep my business and ended their email with asking me to confirm ‚Äòthe best email to send a P45‚Äô to when I gave them notice and to produce my final payslip with them before the extortionate price increase. Received a call from them to say, in a nutshell, that as I negotiated an initial reduced rate that is why the increase is so much so basically I am being penalised for getting a good deal and would pay for it in the end anyway due to the 33% increase.  They then offered me a ¬£20 per payslip charge instead of the ¬£23. So from that it seems the increased costs they are incurring are not as high as they first calculated. I have since sourced an alternative company who are charging me ¬£15 per payslip for the same service so in a way they did me a favour and I‚Äôve ended up saving money.",1,Date of experience: 07 March 2023,Updated 30 Mar 2023

I‚Äôll be leaving Paystream as soon as my expenses are paid. Double taxing is not an option that I will put up with and despite what Paystream‚Äôs response will be to this review, HMRC do not require anything other than a mileage log, which is already detailed in the expense claim that you make via your agency.

After trying to get a refund of the second fee, they said they could only do that if I had another pay coming (which I don't). The high fee is already a rip-off (another umbrella company did the same for me previously for a fee of ¬£10). But to charge that for one day, on a 14-day total job is another level of rip-off.

"Dreadful, best avoided","Weeks of calls, countless on boarding documents, every call handler with a different set of answers or opinions on how it all works.Fact, non-payer who makes lots of excuses, we have to carry out sdc evaluations, payment not received, we‚Äôre missing some information to process payment, the agency hasn‚Äôt paid us, etc, etc, etc.Utter Charltons! I wish id never engaged them!Pa6stream don‚Äôt like honest feedback, they‚Äôre doing their best to have this review removed, so I‚Äôll put all the illustrations in the public domain. These illustrations have had the wrong tax code, ignored pension salary sacrifice, ignored accrued holiday and all these factors have screwed the illustrations to paint a picture of higher take home pay. I ended up talking to a manager call Tom, he even claimed m6 taken home would be adjusted down further due to my tax free income being reconsidered every week with my due payment. Your tax free allowance is set be the tax office (HMRC) once a year, unless your circumstances change. Not by some shady outfit attempting to justify higher engagement costs. Plus you actually need to pay contractors not just  sit on your fingers. This company is inept and I‚Äôll be taking them to tribunal if they make unauthorised deductions!And to Pa6streams response: I have contacted you 5,6 even 7 times in a day debt chasing, all to no avail. I have documented proof of this, for disclosure at recovery ADR!Final update: Paystream claim they‚Äôve done nothing wrong. However they‚Äôve withheld expenses, messed up tax codes, not made the salary sacrifice pensions transfer we set up and it now turns out they‚Äôve signed me up to NEST and although they set it up they claim I have to opt out, from a scheme I have no information of, no details, contact points, etc.This is another stealth deduction taking your day rate down to less than 40%. And they guilty of no wrong doing and have sent emails to the employment agency, Rullion, lying claiming they‚Äôve done their best to sort out the issue, however I‚Äôve not been copied in on these emails and all the emails I‚Äôve received and phone calls I‚Äôve made have been met with condescension and detain.Wow way to compound the lies. See you at Employment Tribunal, thanks for the additional evidence!For contractors reading this review, even though Paystream are doing their very best to have it removed, check out the reviews on offpayroll.org. My experience in not unique, this is a common bad attitude and behaviour of the unscrupulous company that has no integrity or honour!Avoid at all costs, you have been warned!Final: Paystream have generated a new set of payslips that do not correlate to the originals, to create a fake audit trail.They have retained my expenses without making a payout but told the agency they have paid them out.Matter now proceeding to Court!",1,Date of experience: 10 November 2022,Updated 30 Nov 2022

High pressure sales techniques almost boiler room tier, no respect or manners, I could not get a word in at all, when I started asking questions these were completley dismissed as nonsense, undermined any professinoal advice I have been given separatley which is very worrying, the sales reps must be desprate for target as the whole experience reeked of desparation and brute force sales.

Terrible service,"Terrible service, contradictory advice and highly patronising accountants.I had the recent unfortunate experience where the accountant advising me of my dividend situation was not only inpatient witn my queries, but was also extremely rude and subsequently hung up on me. Instead of explaining me on areas that I didn't understand (isn't that part of the service?), he decided to hang up on me because he didnt check facts of my company at his end.When speaking with his manager, I got a similar treatment where despite complaining about the service levels, I was told I would need to wait until they had ""heard"" the audio recording of the conversation?!To make maters worse, both accountants gave me opposite dividend planning advice!And as if it wasn't already bad, I received a separate email from the firm asking me to follow yet another different approach.Not only am I shocked at the lack of client engagement skills and service levels by the accountants, I am really confused as to what the correct accounting guidance I need to follow.It's truly heart breaking to see I have paid so much fees to get this service and advice.Sadly, I don't even know who further to raise this with.I feel totally clueless and helpless about this situation.",1,Date of experience: 27 October 2022,29 Oct 2022

Quoting being the largest umbrella and with great Trustpilot reviews etc. etc. Since then I receive a phone call from them roughly once every two weeks seeking business. It's bordering on harassment and has made my decision to avoid them at all costs an incredibly easy one. No other company has berated me with phone calls since, they've respected my privacy. I'll be going with one of those instead. The PayStream business model is clearly hard sell hard sell hard sell to bring in customers, rather than focusing that effort on providing a quality service.

Steer clear of this company,"Steer clear of this company if you expect to incur expense claims. Their one size fits all approach has no flexibility whatsoever, and they continually hide behind HMRC guidelines. Emails take on average 48 hours to be responded to and you never speak to the same person twice. There are many more umbrella companies out there that understand ad-hoc irregular expense claims.Update as of 13:40 24/5 The expenses they will not pay have been received by paystream from the client and agency I am with, still no sign of a payment.Further update as of 15:30 24/5 I have received a request from paystream for additional information, it must be a full time role for someone to monitor Trustpilot for poor reviews so they can respond to a poor review within a couple of hours of going live yet take 48 hours to reply to email contact and even longer to get expenses paid, and only then, if you can mange the difficult series of hoops you have to jump through.Update - 11:58 25/05 Please read the response from ps as you can see they hide behind HMRC rules as they say, but are actually guidelines, the expenses incurred were paid to ps by the agency and their client, I have had this confirmed. I wonder if they will be returned to the rightful owner if they refuse to pay them to me.As I have said steer well clear of this company you will have nothing but trouble with them",1,Date of experience: 24 May 2022,Updated 25 May 2022

Illustrative amount is not correct and PayStream deduct money from you.,I was originally really happy with the agreement I had with paystream. The illustration showed a very good salary and I left my permanent role for a contract role. I was told that was how much I would make every week (granted I worked 5 days a week). They then have since deducted ¬£50 per week (¬£200 per month!!!!!) and they didn‚Äôt explain that the amount would become less and less the more I worked. I did ask that everything was explained to me properly in the first instance. They should be open and transparent about this. I have done some research and can see that 1) this is a common theme with PayStream as I‚Äôm not the first to complain about this. 2) umbrella companies are apparently notorious for this. I will be looking to complain because I entered into an agreement with pay steam on the basis that I would be paid a certain amount every week. The illustrations states that the cumulative tax was calculated for 52 weeks. They should explain from the outset that pay may vary based on the cumulative tax code.  It‚Äôs very annoying. You‚Äôre playing with people‚Äôs lives and money. Based on what they told me I‚Äôm going to be on less and less each week and will eventually not be able to pay my bills. Thanks PayStream (emphasis on the sarcasm). Edit:I‚Äôve checked with HMRC and they are of the opinion that even based on the cumulative tax code and all the deductions I should be receiving at least ¬£350 more per month. It doesn‚Äôt add up. I‚Äôll be hiring an accounting firm to have a look into this too. Editing this to show 2 stars. Purely based off the fact that one particular employee showed some remorse.,2,Date of experience: 20 May 2022,20 May 2022

Before you do a referral beware !!! - bonkers bonus rules,"I've referred a former colleague to PayStream (PS) however I've just been told that as my agency is Alexander Mann (aka Public Sector Resourcing) I won't be getting any bonus (why does it even matter what agency you use?). I have no idea why a referral bonus ( I thought was a reward for making a personal recommendation) would depend on which agency PS and I are currently liaising with for my current contract. It seems bonkers to me (I am assisting PS with their business not the agency). I now understand why another referral I made never came through. I was recommended to PS by a colleague working in the same place as me (via a different agency) he received a bonus for introducing me to PS!!Note when I initially chased up a few weeks ago I was told I had to wait for my colleague to receive 5 pay slips. I won't be referring again on principle, and thinking of moving away from PS umbrella company again on principle.

Lack of customer care,Despite Paystream being aware of me terminating my employment through recorded calls they enrolled me onto a Nest Pension scheme which I explained wasnt required. I phoned Nest direct who said it made no sense to go thru the admin of setting up a pension and that they had yet to receive the pension contribution. They therefore advised Paystream to call their employer line directly to  resolve. Paystream refused to speak with them. They made no effort to resolve the situation but rather I write an official complaint which I will do. Avoid this company if you are looking for an umbrella company to provide good customer outcome built on trust and who are prepared to go the extra mile for its customers.,1,Date of experience: 19 April 2022,19 Apr 2022

Unhappy Customer,"I had a real nightmare when joining Paystream initially‚Ä¶this really should have been my warning.  One of their team actually said to me he was ‚Äòtotally embarrassed‚Äô about how my onboarding  was handled. That was 3 years ago. Eventually as an apology of a couple of weeks non payment of the weekly margin payment was agreed‚Ä¶ Since then pockets of issues and I know I am sensitive to whatever happens because of ongoing issues.  As one other unhappy reviewer said here on trust pilot,  we pay to get our wages/ tax correct‚Ä¶..but there always seems to be something that goes wrong.  I had insisted on ‚Äòdedicated‚Äô support as one of the issues was repeating the same thing over and over because there is no continuity and then mistakes happen multiple times. You are just a number.   For the most part this dedicated arrangement I insisted on has been OK, since the last lot of issues anyway,  but again, how hard can it be.   However, I moved contracts recently‚Ä¶checked 3 times all was in place/ no misunderstandings and changed this time to being paid for holidays when I am  on leave and not having this included in a weekly wage‚Ä¶..then on my first wage‚Ä¶could see my instruction had not been carried out.  I raised a complaint because the person I raised this with ( not my dedicated resource as not available) did not see fit to explain the implications I was trying to understand. So hard to deal with when we are busy on our contracts and have no time for this or policing the umbrella company üòîüòîüòî They insist you be inconvenienced further and put it in writing what you have just conveyed on the call‚Ä¶..I specifically asked for a manager to review and contact me.  I was told they would‚Ä¶still waiting. No one thinks enough of my custom t call me, or acknowledge which manager is dealing.‚Ä¶just my usual contact has emailed a few days later saying it was  ‚Äòmisunderstanding‚Äô and can r change from next week‚Ä¶..meanwhile the next weeks wage in and we still have no resolution.  I really think there is a lack of management and leadership‚Ä¶no one cares basically.   I have a need to understand what now happens given my instructions were not carried out and there is no money filtered into my holiday pot, should I take holidays if they switch me to what I asked for in the first place now that we have missed a few weeks‚Ä¶but no one cares to explain.  I really am so very, very frustrated, when all I have ever wanted to do if get paid what I am due and receive no tax bills ‚Ä¶..Paystream are always quick to ‚Äòcrow‚Äô about awards they have won, but my experience really does not rate any award.  I would think that any company who values it‚Äôs customers would have a  process to quickly deal with any issue/ formal complaint‚Ä¶..but no ‚Äòmanagers‚Äô seem to be in the picture or care enough to provide that care and turn things around. I respectfully request a senior manager to review my issues, and actually contact me with some sincerity.",1,Date of experience: 07 April 2022,7 Apr 2022

Strongly advise against,"Strongly advise against - each time you call up you get a different response / guidance on their own internal processes, and email responses take ages.Reason it's not one star is that the individuals on the phone are generally polite - it is clear it's Paystream's processes.If you have alternative provider's, I suggest you select them",2,Date of experience: 15 March 2022,15 Mar 2022
Don't rely on PayStream for references,"I signed up for PayStream last month and the onboarding process was excellent; I couldn't have asked for more.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the quality of service once you're fully on board. Specifically, I urgently need a reference confirming my income for a tenancy application, but so far my emails have been met with silence. Obviously it's understandable that they might be busy, but customer service 101 would be to at least give an ETA for the reference request and to explain what the reference would contain -- I'd expect that these processes should be streamlined and take no more than 30 seconds.So now I'm at risk of losing the tenancy over PayStream's slowness -- needless to say I'm very disappointed.UPDATE: PayStream did eventually send a reference through to the lettings agency, but my tenancy application was denied on the basis that PayStream refused to confirm that I was a permanent employee, in spite of everything in my employment contract implying otherwise. (I now need to spend a lot of time and money on redoing my moving plans, so thanks for that!)On multiple occasions I requested an explanation of why exactly my contract was not that of a permanent employee, but the only replies I received were laughable canned responses that blatantly contradicted the employment contract itself (e.g. saying ""your employment is based on the assignments you chose to complete"", which is the exact opposite of what my contract says). I can only speculate as to the reasons why PayStream is unwilling to even explain why I am apparently not a permanent employee, but my suspicion is that it's the usual story of a company trying to shirk their responsibilities towards their employees a la Deliveroo and Uber. In actual fact I don't even care that much about having ""permanent employee"" status -- I was perfectly happy in the past as a self-employed contractor -- but being able to tick the box of being a permanent employee *is* something that's very useful for mortgage/tenancy applications and the like, and PayStream has proved itself to be woefully inadequate for even this basic task.No doubt PayStream will respond by saying ""we've given thousands of references in the past and it's never been an issue"", but frankly I just don't believe them. They might well be adequate if the reference checking is half-baked, but if you're renting or buying a property in a highly competitive market like London,  you can expect the checks to be a lot stricter and the standard reference that PayStream provides just won't cut it.Long story short: don't go with these guys if you can avoid them. Umbrella company services are a dime a dozen and all the competitors I checked are happy to openly state that they hire workers on the basis that they're classed as permanent employees, which is pretty important if you care about references for mortgage/tenancy applications.",1,Date of experience: 14 March 2022,Updated 24 Mar 2022

These people are rubbish,"These people are rubbish! Why I say this with all their great reviews, dodo. Imagine they said to my agency that, they don't send no one to work until all checks are done, I went to work three weeks ago for Fulham Timber on behalf of Driver Hire Croydon, believing Friday 10th February 2022 my pay will be in my account. First when I phoned a staff member said and told me! Oh we have not received your portal confirmation that's why we sent it to your email address, I then asked which email address cause I have not received any emails from you lots. Then the lady said okay I will send it you again now!  I waited on the phone, she said I have sent it again have you received it I answered No! She then said have you got another email address we can send it to again! I gave her my other email address, she sent it and I received it, I then said to the lady after I do this can you I get pay to she said answered Yes! I filled it up quickly and this was from after 9am in the morning. When I phoned back to asked if they have got it, someone else answers the phone so you all know the routine, you explain everything back again, so I did.Just for this staff to tell me oh we are doing your right to work check, BULL they have got every document they told Driver Hire to request from me, they got my National insurance number and they have my biometric share code and they still refuse to pay me for the 3 days until they get confirmation that I am allow to work. I have been working ever since I finished school. How comes is only when I phoned to check for my pay that's when you sent me the app portal? Why send me to work when all checks was not completed?I have a 5 year old daughter and a 10 month old son and you people are playing with my pay, I can't pay my bills. I can't go to my new job without asking someone for help. I can't buy nothing for my childrens from the corner shop. And you people are going on like you are the best thing since slice bread! They go on like they know the laws they know Fuckall! Everyone knows you can't work without a National insurance number, so if you have a National insurance number with your full name it must means you can work in the UK dud duds.I don't like to pull the race card out but this is behind racism and I tell you the readers why I came to this conclusion:My name Shaka Conteh My place of birth Africa So by the above 2 means I have a green book, but I also have a update passport with a biometric share code, okay here is the easy part all Paystream have to do cause the NI number don't mean nothing to them. So all they had to do since 10th Friday February 2022 after 9am in the morning was call immigration on the phone they would have told them what they wanted to hear, how I know is because I have been in the UK 1988, immigration will give you the answer you want. So I am warning all Professional Drivers out or anyone thinking of joining a agency out there please avoid PAYSTREAM the are Rubbish and dodo especially.On that note I wish you lots read this cause I want your managers to read it too and see how you lots treat hard working people and you can take as long as you want but in the end you have to pay me.Evening readers!!! Yup they still haven't paid me my wages, I am still struggling can't afford petrol, lunch the list goes on. Imagine my new job will pay me in a week time and I started working for my new employer in the same week I worked the 3 days which Paystream supposed to have paid me for last week. Imagine!!!!!OMG Now I have an expired passport with my infinite stay!  I gave these people 2 passport 1 up to date and the old 1 with my stay like you said to your reply, so readers that them 2 passports are enough plus you talk about biometric card. Haven't you got the share code I sent you from the Home Office, which said I'm waiting for it but I can use the share code now. Readers I'm working for a company bigger than these Paystream so how comes they can pay me with the 2 same documents. Paystream you can copy and paste all you want I have right to stay and work in UK so build the interests for me. Readers I thought Slavery days was finish!!! All now you are replying to my rating on Trustpilot but don't have the decency to call or text me, but you have the time to go and copy and paste information from the Home Office website, I have been in living in England for 30 over years, I have 7 childrens that I try to look after without being on state benefits I have never stolen or rub anyone I work hard for everything I have and own. SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO RUB ME? What because I am black and don't have a Red book or please tell me.

Paystream couldnt care less,"Paystream couldnt care lessAfter their talented sales team were rather convincing, I decided to try switch umbrella companies. I was told by paystream that they would take care of the umbrella transition process and all that I would require to do was get a P45 from my previous umbrella ltd. About a month after joining paystream, I started to get abit worried as I hadnt recieved any payments or payslips.. and basically no updates whatsoever. I phoned their ""customer care"" numerous times trying to ascertain what was going on. I was told that no pay had come from the source agency and that there is nothing more they can do as they have tried to contact the agency but havent received a response. What annoys me is that they never tried to contact me or update me on the issues that they were having. I could have potentially help them.I then took matters into my own hands and started asking questions to the source agency who paystream where meant to be dealing with.I found the source agency to respond to me very quickly and it turned out that paystream didnt even have a contract signed! A month later and no pay in my account I decided that it was pointless to be a paystream employee and quit. So thanks for nothing Paystream! What a waste of time and effort. (well no effort was wasted on your behalf as you couldnt care less!)I wish I read these paystream reviews before I tried to switch umbrellas.. oh well.. once bitten, twice shy.If you thinking about switching, dont believe the fluff!

They confirmed on the phone AND via email that they would not so going forward, but when a new contract did come through they accepted it again with my permission!. They simply stated this was down to ""human error"" which seems to be a term they use quiet frequently 2.Following a pay increase they paid me the lower amount .When I questioned this stated that they had  paid me what my agency had invoiced them. They left me to sort this out and it turned out my agency had invoiced the higher rate!! No apologies for the error 3. My pension plan returned some funds to them which Paystream continuously states they had not received. It was not until I was able to obtain evidence that the money had been paid to them over a month earlier that they miraculous contacted me saying I was due a payment from my pension plan . Again no apologies4. Good luck getting any assistance when querying anything. You will speak to and receive emails from several different people who will have not looked at your previous history leading to the situation where you'll have to constantly repeat yourself. I have never posted a negative review for any company before but I've only been with them since April 2021 and  this is some the worst service I have ever experienced.

Firstly, because of the quality of the industry knowledge and consultancy advice they provide both our Recruitment Consultants and our Contractors - it's second to none and always informative and clear.  Secondly, Paystream are always happy to go the extra mile when we need their urgent support in times of pressing pay and consultancy requirements, whether that be giving one of our customers a call to offer immediately required advice or to force through an advanced immediate payment ahead of schedule for one of our contractors who is in urgent need.Last but very much not least, our assigned Consultants at Paystream, Jamie-Lee and Laura, are always available, supportive and genuinely do everything they can to support our contractors' support needs as quickly and professionally as possible.  There's definitely no hiding behind company mail inboxes or restrictive SLAs to gain the advice we need.  Their friendly and professional approach, combined with their in-depth industry knowledge, is also backed up by high quality technology solutions that makes transacting with Paystream as easy as possible for our contractors.I really can't recommend Paystream and our Consultant experience via Jamie-Lee and Laura highly enough.

Not a good company to be involved in,"The mark of a good company is when things go wrong, what they will do to correct them. Unfortunately, Paystream have demonstrated that they cannot deal with any issues. They collected tax and NI contributions from my expenses which meant I was severely out of pocket. The company paid the expenses all in good faith that I would get fully refunded. They have refused to listen to the agency and have refused to communicate with me. Not impressed at all. I really feel cheated by this company.  Since this review was posted, Paystream have contacted me twice. Once to ask for more info and the other to say they cannot locate me.  Amazing how they can respond to a review but not me directly, even though they have been chased a number of times both by me and the agency. Also amazing that I cannot be located, which I have noted has been used before in a reply. What you did is NOT acceptable and you are trying to hide behind answers that no one can make any sense of.

I have raised several times that they are incorrectly calculating and recording my pay, to be fobbed off with varying explanations that make NO SENSE. Anyone who has even gotten to NVQ3 AAT would have covered this. They take 2 months to pay your pension contributions out after deducting them AND charge you an additonal ¬£25 every time AND they still opted me in to their pension even though I repeatedly told them not to and they had already paid into my private one. Also your leaving date is whenever they feel like recording it after they process your last pay, not your last day worked (so weeks if not months after you've left) and so can cause serious issues for your tax code as you'll show as having dual employment. I am in the middle of supplying evidence for the case I've raised with HMRC as repeated emails to Paystream just result in their staff fobbing you off.

Poor service,Paystream screwed up my leaving and didn‚Äôt pay my last payment. Had to chase them and ended receiving less than expected as they were too lazy to process properly and I paid more tax than I should have.Won‚Äôt be using them again.,1,Date of experience: 14 August 2021,14 Aug 2021
"1 Disappointing - if you use them, beware","1. The online payment system was clunky and I couldn‚Äôt get it to work. The workaround was to email staff with your hours for thw week, and they did the necessary at their end. They were very quick to offer it and although I asked to do it myself, it didn‚Äôt seem possible. I got the impression it wasn‚Äôt well set up. (My current umbrella organisation‚Äôs online portal is so easy to use by comparison).2. I chose to have holiday pay put aside, not paid upfront. As my contract came to an end and we were winding up, they said and did nothing about it. I had assumed it would be automatically included in my final payment but when I went to check I saw it hadn‚Äôt. I had to ask them to pay it. The delayed payment of my holiday pay fell in the new tax year, and gave me an additional tax liability (also partly because I was wrongly coded by them - see below).3. With Paystream you pay both employee‚Äôs and employer‚Äôs NI which is unfair. That doesn‚Äôt happen in my current umbrella outfit.4. I gave clear instructions on starting with Paystream about my correct tax coding. They subsequently altered this without reference to me or drawing it to my attention. When I complained about this later, they said it was because of an apparent discrepancy with the tax code on my P45. The P45 pre-dated my instruction to them. They could and should have contacted me about it to clarify it but they did not. When I eventually discovered what had happened, I complained. There was an exchange of emails over several days in which they said again and again ‚Äònot our fault, nothing we could or should have done differently.‚Äô Poor customer service and bad complaints handling. Their poor service has cost me multiple calls with HMRC to sort it out.5. While I was still under contract and before the tax and holiday pay problems showed up, I had recommended Paystream to a friend as an umbrella company. She decided to go with them. I later saw on one of the Paystream emails I got that they were offering a ¬£50 thank you for successful recommendations. I‚Äôd had no idea that was on offer but was chuffed to think I‚Äôd get a reward. I let them know who I‚Äôd recommended, and she told them when she joined that I‚Äôd recommended her. But Paystream said that I wasn‚Äôt entitled to the reward because my friend hadn‚Äôt yet completed 4 weeks in her job, and by the time she had, my contract had ended (even though she signed up while I was still with them). So, no ‚Äòthank you‚Äô for me! That just feels so shabby. The other problems re tax code and holiday pay blew up after I recommended the friend, otherwise I most definitely wouldn‚Äôt have put anyone their way. Personally, I‚Äôd avoid them.",2,Date of experience: 14 August 2021,Updated 14 Aug 2021

Also the small fee they take to set everything up, liaise with 3rd parties, be available whenever you have a question or query about an invoice, timesheet, expense, sort out your PAYE, NI and pension contributions and produce a payslip is well worth it. The portal is easy to use and intuitive. The only small gripe I have is that the payslip itself is a little confusing and unnecessarily complicated, but a small detail.

Avoid - Unprofessional service and sweeps complaints under the carpet !!!,"I had hoped PayStream Management would have replied to proactively resolve my complaint however they chosen to not reply.Used to be good been with them for over a year but now their service and attitude for inconsistent replies and sweeping issues under the carpet was the last straw.Avoid these bunch of Unprofessional amateurs.Incompetent Customer Care Representatives.Forget trying to get Salary Sacrifice, they admitted that there is low uptake - no wonder as you're told a lie and pension provider says they've not had comms from these Unprofessional amateurs.When enquiring about Key Information Document this was quickly brushed off and deflected away from them when it came into effect.Unprofessional Service.Forget raising a complaint and questions they get swept up under the carpet.And for any replies to this review from PayStream  Marketing, Management and Customer Care team have all been included in my complaint and noone wants to reply to the hard fact truths, raised to FCSA.Zero transparency and gross incompetence, not one single management team replies and when asking for complaint to be escalated I'm told that it won't be escalated so if that's not going to raise alarm bells then I don't know what counts for sweeping things under the carpet.Completely avoid.There are other umbrellas that give a better service and you're not treated like a number and issues go unresolved.Complaints swept up under the carpet.Management, Marketing and CS team's have been in all comms, and 0 responses. They are incapable of reading emails and answering them, continously avoiding questions that require answering.They claim wrongly on quite a number of things to which I've had to correct their incoherent and incorrect information making it look like their staff are actually working then go silent when clearly pointing out the facts and setting the record straight, obviously poor training and lack of accountability.They create multiple email threads so its near impossible to keep track of what is going on.They don't replies to all your comms - they claim to but when they have incompetent staff (which they choose to not deal with internally) nor deal with the issues & complaints & when presenting evidence they go silent - they are not fit for purpose to be an umbrella company.Also noted that shortly after raising my complaint then questionable content arrived into my inboxes.I have given them a very long time nearly half a year to deal with my complaint and a final last chance before making this review and not one single representative replied back whatsoever - not even any attempt to resolve them or reach out.Given the evidence that proves incompetence obviously highlights deep problems in their company.They chase their own tails internally and unable to read emails and deal with what is their job.So glad I moved away from them and the people who I referred also moved away from them !Umbrella Providers are now being debated in Parliament ü§û1 star is far too good for them, given they are complacent in the comms and going silent.Paystream have had their chance to resolve my complaint and questions and I am not going to share my details as you've had your chances and you decided to go silent and not engage.I fully expect the same generic PR replies from paystream to this review like all the other bad reviews they get, unfortunately you all had your chances and decided to go silent and not engage....Edit in response: What a load of tosh 100% a complete fabrication, I could make public all the clear detailed information with dates and timelines and myself repeatedly following up with yourselves and your simple refusal to deal with the questions that I raised.I have nothing to hide.

The service agents on the phone have no idea why the employee dashboard is not showing anything. I've been chasing them for weeks to get paid. Two full months of pay now outstanding and I don't even know if they will ever manage to short out their admin issues to resolve this. Don't use. You've been warned. While I write this, I am still chasing their ""customer service"", ""complaints team"" and ""compliance team"" -- I would not even give it one star!Edit after Paystream are asking me for more info. I am not going to share my full name, phone and reference on a public site. This was shared with you privately. I am also now chasing down my April payment.

Abysmal,"I joined Paystream as they had some good reviews on this site and promised they could set me up in a couple of days and pay directly into my own personal pension.It took over 2 weeks before I was setup and this cost me a full weeks paid work.Another month on and the pension payments have not been sorted so I am having to pay a huge amount of tax on upper earnings that I would rather avoid by topping up my pension.You cna only contact them via email and each time a different person responds, when you reply it takes a day or two and then the reply is from someone else.I suspect when things go smoothly they are good, but I tell a good company from a bad one based on how they deal with thtings when they go wrong and the simple answer is paystream just don't care.I even said if they cannot resolve this then I will be forced to leave and they just said you can leave right away if you wish.",1,Date of experience: 22 April 2021,22 Apr 2021

Great service and professional friendly staff.,"I found the service provided to be comprehensive and easy to use. The Web Platform is simple to navigate and has all the information you could wish for about your company finances in one place. The personal support provided either by phone or email was also very good. I spoke to knowledgeable and friendly people who cared about me and my company. Response times were always good. They provided comprehensive advice and explained things simply. They helped me establish my PSC and with their assistance I went from zero to being confident and well informed about running a company.On the down side I considered the fees a little excessive compared to a high street accountant, especially for a one man band such as myself. But in fairness they did everything for me and all I needed to do was upload receipts, mileage information etc. Other than that I would give 5 stars.",4,Date of experience: 17 April 2021,17 Apr 2021

Highly recommend to go with Paystream if you are unsure, they will not disappoint you!",5,Date of experience: 16 April 2021,16 Apr 2021
Patchy at best,"Patchy at best. I joined Paystream to use their umbrella services in April 2021. Confusing payments:Initially I was told I would be paid one weeks in arrears, then I received documentation informing me it would be  four weeks in arrears. I rang to check and was told it would be four weeks in arrears. I was actually paid one week in arrears. Upon querying this with paystream, they confirmed it should have been one month in arrears, and that being paid one week in arrears was an error and so I would have to wait another three weeks before being paid again. Day rate was wrong:I was underpaid because the wrong day rate had been used. I queried this with Paystream and it was resolved with a faster payment the next day. It would have been better if I hadn‚Äôt been underpaid in the first place. Paystream had a record of the correct pay rate but quoted the wrong one on my pay slip. I doubt it would have been identified without me raising it. Wrong assignment dates:My agency informed Paystream of my assignment dates, I received an assignment from Paystream with different dates from those I had agreed with the client. I queried this and was told it would be resolved. My agency then decided to change my assignment dates right before the assignment start date. Paystream said they would provide me with an updated assignment. I chased it a week later and heard nothing until I complained and was told they hadn‚Äôt been informed of the new dates by my agency. I asked my agency to resend the information and then next day Paystream sent me an updated assignment. I asked Paystream to waive the weekly fee as I hadn‚Äôt received good service from them but they said they wouldn‚Äôt do this. My experience with Paystream could have been worse but it could also have been so much better. As a contractor who is new to umbrella arrangements, I just wanted two things: get my assignment right and get my pay right from the start. Neither of these are unreasonable requests. Unfortunately, they failed on both counts.Update: since submitting this review, I have since received another assignment from Paystream with the wrong dates on. I am tired of this.",2,Date of experience: 15 April 2021,Updated 20 Apr 2021
Superb Onboarding Process,Can't say enough about how impressed I have been with the onboarding process which has been really efficient.

PayStream expectations exceeded,"PayStream have far exceeded my expectations as an umbrella company.  I had no prior experience of umbrellas and I was originally drawn to their service because of their pension salary sacrifice option to me which seemed a strong differentiating factor in a marketplace that seemed quite generic. I never expected (or expected I would need!) prompt and helpful customer service but PayStream have facilitated contract renewals in good time, they have managed my pension salary sacrifice arrangements promptly and they have been incredibly helpful supporting a recent mortgage application which has prompted this review. I only have experience of one umbrella company but I cannot imagine how any of them could improve on the experience I have has with PayStream (MyMax).",5,Date of experience: 31 March 2021,31 Mar 2021

The irony of sending me this BS response from an email address named ""Customer Care"" is sickening. You clearly don't care at all.PayStream: We have recently tried to contact you to establish your current work situation as we haven't processed any payments for you in over 4 weeks.  As we have been unsuccessful in contacting you we have now processed your P45 which ends your employment through PayStream.So, there you go. They really are absolutely, bloody useless.

My experience is far from good,My experience is far from good. The practices of Paystream are far from transparent.The company denies any responsibilities where the fault is rather clear. Double taxation is something we all should be worried about. There are plenty much better umbrellas on the market so think twice before signing with this one. Our issue is being reported to the regulator including HMRC and court. Any negative comment is quickly followed by the company response trying to decline the issue or pass it forward on the contractor. Read the online reviews about Paystream. There is quite a few exposing bad practices.,1,Date of experience: 01 February 2021,1 Feb 2021

"Professional, supportive and competent","Paystream have been supportive and exceptionally helpful every step of the way! From the very first stages of having to set up a Limited company, researching and choosing an accountancy firm to use for work purposes, Paystream stood out from the rest with their calm manner and ability to answer all of my questions clearly without jargon. This was a big relief to me, someone who was completely new to using an accountancy firm, as well as Paystream having a refreshing approach compared with other accountancy firms that I had contacted whilst researching where best to take my business. Some other accountancy firms had been extremely pushy for the sale, as well using scare monger tactics by saying that only their firm could offer the correct package that I needed, and boarder line harassment, receiving up to four calls a day from one accountancy firm as to whether or not I had made my decision to use their services or not. Paystream did not once make me feel uneasy about the decision to use their services. My advisor, Mollie, was always quick to respond to any questions I had, and never made me feel uneasy when I needed the same question explained in a different way to further my understanding. It was also very settling that I had consistency with being able to address my queries to Mollie, rather than my questions being passed to a team, and having responses from unknown team members. Paystream have assisted me with completing my taxes and also provided me different options when making big decisions around my company, giving me autonomy over how I want to handle certain situations. I am about to close my company, as I am no longer needing to trade as a Limited company, however, I would have no hesitation in the future to return to Paystream, if I would need to use an accountancy firm again.",5,Date of experience: 23 October 2020,23 Oct 2020

Worst paye umbrella. Better go on benefits than use these,"Do not trust one word of what the new business team of this company says to entice you to sign up. This opportunistic company told all lies to contractors who had to find a paye provider in Feb 2020 due to ir35 changes. Experience of dealing with this company is making me seriously regret the decision to continue contracting with umbrella companies altogether and honestly it is better to go on benefits. At least then you will have stress of only dealing with false promises of jobcenter and not the double stress of your work and dealing with false promises of opportunistic companies like paystream. To sign me up they promised that they can contribute to both my pension plans. Then once I signed up, they started to say oh no sorry we can only do to one. Then I chose one of the two - my primary one to which I wanted to contribute bulk to, they said oh no we do not support them. This despite having both the names in the prospectus they sent me. Tried to fob me off by sending me ‚Äúnew‚Äù prospectus. Luckily I was able to reply with ‚Äúold‚Äù prospectus and email confirmation I had from before signing up. Then they sent me bunch of forms and claimed they will make an exception and contribute to one provider of my choice. Needless to say, the form was ignored and they started to contribute to NEST. Then I had to wait for NEST opt out and even after that was done, they managed to send payment to NEST again. When I asked why, they replied with sorry here are bunch more forms we forgot to send you earlier. Long story short - six months later I am still without pension contributions which were supposed to start from second week of signing up. Of course all this while they have been helping themselves to extra 6¬£ per week admin charges for pension contributions. Oh yes, and despite telling them not to they keep helping themselves to holiday payments  when I have told clearly (and acknowledged by them) I want paying out immediately. All this during already uncertain times of Covid lockdowns - I have added stress of no pension during this critical time and paying extra for the privilege. Whatever you do - do not believe one word of what new business team tells you - this is not a trustworthy company. Either find a permanent role, or a contract where you can still use your Ltd company. Umbrellas such as these are just opportunistic thugs.",1,Date of experience: 04 August 2020,Updated 4 Aug 2020
My experience with Paystream in the UK‚Ä¶,"My experience with Paystream in the UK was a life changing one that produced the lowest point in my working life of 40 years in the automotive industry, it was totally negative and sole destroying and no one should work with them if it is at all possible.The first point before I elaborate my own case is that they may be well intentioned individuals but how many advisors are actually qualified as accountants.From February 2014 to October 2018, I worked as a supplier quality engineer in a large automotive company in the Midlands and enjoyed the challenges of new systems as I had only worked for GM and Ford in Spain. The beginning of 2020 I was presented a Tax Bill from the Spanish authorities for 14,600 Euros of undeclared income and a fine for 10,300 Euros relative 2014 tax year. As Paysteam had all the information and my company and personal income data, plus I had taken out extra insurance for tax investigation, I had the impression that they would help me resolve the misunderstanding as in theory one should not be double taxed on the same income.Paysteam have no idea about EU tax agreements and the investigation insurance ‚Äúwe do not do Spain‚Äù which made it about a useful as used toilet paper.I have spent 4,500 Euros on Spanish accountants and translators, but still have to pay the tax and fines or the authorities will embargo my house.I am not looking for hand out, but a hand to help me resolve the mess which Paysteam have left me in and are not willing to put any time of effort in helping me resolve the situation that I find myself.Conclusion is that as long as Paysteam are taking money from you for very little effort and you do not bother them to much it is ok with them, but if you have any problems they may help if you pay them extra or maybe not as they do not have the capacity or the knowledge to do it.",1,Date of experience: 20 July 2020,20 Jul 2020

E.g. They suggest you pay all expenses with your personal card and everyone that knows about contracting knows you are meant to pay them with your business account. Why? Because it's more work for your self-assessment which they charge separately for.- They are opportunists: IR35 was supposed to happen this year, so a few months earlier, they raised their closing company fees from ¬£300 to ¬£450, how convenient.- Their leaving documentation is a joke: my new accountant couldn't believe I was paying so much and they couldn't even break down the report of income and expenses for every month, so it was a mess for them.- They skipped information: Their report didn't include a transaction I made with my business account, the only one I made since peers strongly recommended me to start using my business card for expenses.- They are expensive compared to many other alternatives in the market: I'm now provided with a monthly report of the calculation of my dividends and salary which I was not being provided with Paystream.

Good umbrella company,"Have been with PayStream for almost 2 years now using their umbrella company service.

Either way, they respond to emails the quickly/same day, provide clear illustrations for pay, provided letters to help me with my mortgage application and I've always been paid on time. My main negative is their association with Haven Global Strategies (for contractor mortgages). Anyone who's tried to get a mortgage as an umbrella contractor knows how complicated the entire thing is, so Haven giving me the bare minimum when it came to initial advice was VERY unhelpful.

Terrible company,"Terrible company, my payments are always late because they are late submitting them and that is only if they actually get them right!

Hostile with new business,"I'm a limited company contractor who may need to use an umbrella.  So I'm contacting those recommended to me.  My accountant suggested Paystream.I used the form on the website to ask for a callback so that I could ask about what they could do for me.  About 30 mins later I got a call from ""Steven"" who refused to answer any questions unless I gave him date of birth, and enough personal information that he could work out a pay calculation and tell me what I would take home.  This simply wasn't what I wanted to know.  Naturally I declined.  I asked if he could tell me what their charges were and he refused to tell me(!)  I don't pay people to create problems.  Weird.Oh well.  On to the next.",1,Date of experience: 25 February 2020,25 Feb 2020

Shockingly incompetent,"I was persuaded to go with Paystream as the agency I got my contract through suggested them and told me they work with them regularly.  I suspect now that there could have been commission being passed, but hey as long as they did the job then it wouldn't impact me. THE ONLY PROBLEM is they HAVEN'T done their job and after 11 weeks I'm owed thousands of pounds and fighting to get tax back when it shouldn't have been taken. The customer service people are very polite and try to help but to be honest uf the accountants can't sort it in 11 weeks I doubt if they can. Yes, lovely and professional at the beginning to entice you in but shockingly incompetent.",1,Date of experience: 24 January 2020,24 Jan 2020
NO SALARY,"My company agreed on weekly payment, PayStream confirmed all is good, and I will get my salary weekly. On the day I supposed to get my first salary, I got an e-mail that I'm going to get paid 3 weeks later. I have two kids to feed, and I'm the breadwinner in the family. I sent them the agreement, the back up documents. NO RESPONSE. They are very nice in the start, but once you signed the contract, they don't care. I asked them about my TAX, they could not explain. I have screenshots about the conversations.",1,Date of experience: 24 January 2020,Updated 24 Jan 2020

"They're 'ok', but WAY too expensive. They're just not worth it. Shop around.","The portal they offer is fine. And the team of accountants that look after are prompt and helpful, but it's not worth ¬£180 a month!If you're new to their services (like I was as a first time contractor) then it's easy for their sales team to suck you in. What's worse is they lock you into a 3 month contract. Do not buy business insurance through them, it's extortionate, and they neglect to mention that it's only 3 months of cover until AFTER you've paid for it. There's clearly a kick-back going on here. My work contract was only for 3 months, so services offered such as annual returns etc are worthless as you'd have to stick with them  for the rest of the tax year to be able to utilise the services, in the meantime paying ¬£180 every month. It's very subtle, but the 'personal illustration' they send you to lure you in is not quite accurate, it's designed to make your retained earnings look better than they actually will be.it's best to shop around, maybe go with someone local.",2,Date of experience: 07 January 2020,7 Jan 2020
Avoid. Especially if you need to process expenses,"Avoid.My work includes a lot of travel and thankfully, I never stayed long enough to have to do many expense claims. It took about six calls to Paystream to get them to finally admit there was a problem with an expense claim that they took back from my salary after repeatedly claiming that it was not HMRC claimable (airfare and hotel in the US and Europe)Five different people there told me the same cop-out of blaming HMRC, two of them even contradicted themselves, saying it was because of underpayment of the middle-man agency as well as the HMRC copout. It took six months to get my business expenses back, which, for trips to the US and Germany got expensive fast.Additionally, their expenses portal is woefully inadequate. It seems geared only to people working within the UK (GBP only - you have to do FOREX conversions yourself) and only works Monday to Friday - it will give you errors and actually not allow you to claim anything beyond five days of meals in a week, so I guess if you're working abroad long term as I was, you're going to have to either go hungry at the weekend, or somehow rig your weekend meal expenses into the system under a different category, which will inevitably get them scrutinised and delayed even more.For example, I've been a consultant for twenty years now and this was the first time through multiple companies that I was told I cannot make a meal claim from a grocery store. Any road warrior can tell you this is the most efficient way of buying/claiming multiple meals for long term away-from-home stays. It seems that under the guise of threatening to not approve your claim, paystream will force you into eating from a restauarant for every meal every day, but then not allow you to claim more than five days in a seven day week, obviously.Getting someone competent on the phone who didn't just play the blame game was the biggest issue. Everything is HMRC's fault when it comes to them putting their hand in your pocket.I will be taking any future contracting work elsewhere. Likely back to the US. Working in the UK is too bureaucratic, without incompetence being thrown in.edit: Just got off the phone with them. After putting calling and texting me today, they had to put me on hold, because they could find no record of me in their system.Yes, of course I'd like my P45.

Variable quality of umbrella/limited company services - not entirely recommended,"Variable quality of umbrella and limited company management services for contractors.Straightforward stuff is easy for both areas and recommended as such.The portal for the limited company management is great.Problems and more complex issues are a pain and I would seriously consider moving to another company if I get any more of these.Most recently they've been sloppy on questions around a tax return - and also directly resulted in a warning on my HMRC file totally because they didn't do two things they told me they would on my VAT payment.
