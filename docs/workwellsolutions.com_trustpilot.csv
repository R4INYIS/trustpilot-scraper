I really don't know what they are doing for my £120/month. I am an ecommerce business running via Shopify. Firstly, they did not set up the Shopify/Freeagent feed (which my other accountant did), but left this to me, so because it has been set up late, I now have something like 300 transactions that I have to manually split out because the feed only started a week ago and cannot be backdated.  Secondly, I have been asking them for literally months to set up loan accounts for Shopify loans that I've taken, and to date they still have not done this, so I now have nearly 200 transactions I cannot explain because there is nowhere to put them.  Thirdly, they just never seem to even look at my accounts whatsoever and drag their heels over answering any queries.",1,Date of experience: 01 October 2024,1 Oct 2024

"Complete ""Clowns"" and their staff told…","Complete ""Clowns"" and their staff told me a complete pack of lies, which were all disproved by HMRC on the phone (Yes, Workwell, HMRC can see what you are doing, including making checks that you have never done on my CIS/UTR number). See the catalogue of lies here:  Bad Decision 1 - They paid me at the rate of CIS deduction -30% without writing or calling to alert me of a potential issue (it should have been -20% of course). Some communication here would have solved the problem if this company was legit, but I think they did it with intent as things went from bad to worse;    Bad Decision 2 - When I called to ask what they were playing at, they said there was a problem with my UTR/CIS status. When that argument was shot down in flames, I stated that they could not have even checked my UTR, as another Umbrella Company had paid me for the same week for a night shift, validated my URT/CIS and charged the correct rate of 20%. Then they tried the next lie; see Bad Decision 3 below;  Bad Decision 3 - They then invented fake correspondence from HMRC, that they had it writing via HMRC notifications just today that my UTC/CIS has a problem and my rate of deduction should be charged at the deduction rate of -30%; this is despite me having the UTR/CIS since 2004 and never once having a problem with it. I rang HMRC to check this story out, which not only proved to be complete rubbish, but they also confirmed that Workwell had made no UTR/CIS check; HMRC can see all Ping's/Validation by 3rd parties on their systems.  Bad Decision 4 - I rang Workwell back up to tell them that HMRC had confirmed their lies from Bad Decision 2 + 3 above and that my assumptions that I was being lied to more than once were correct; they then went on to make bad decision 5, see below;  Bad Decision 5 – They then came out with, ""Well, it's quite normal for new people joining a new Umbrella Company to be charged 30%"" Of course, this is just more ""Complete Crap""! I've used 10's and 10's of various Umbrella Companies over the years for multiple contracts, and I have never been charged 30% for the first few weeks. What happened here is either:  A: They had bad cash flow and were looking for ways to temporarily claw money off people so they could make their payment run.   B: They could not be Fu&^ed to check my UTR/CIS because they had left everything to the last minute.   Bad Decision 6 – Once all of their complete pack of lies unravelled, they are still refusing to pay me the discrepancy of 10%. If this situation continues another few days and into next week, they will soon find the issue will be settled in the Small Claims Court. Overall, I would steer clear of this Umbrella Company; the lies and dishonesty are genuinely shocking, and there is a risk you will be left out of pocket!",1,Date of experience: 13 September 2024,Updated 15 Sept 2024

Outrageously greedy!!!,I am not impressed with this company. I am a supply teacher getting paid £260 a day. In 3 weeks and 3 days I have only received £2126.73. Total income before tax is £4680. They have kept £2580. This is just greedy. They keep sending me payslips but the money is not in my account. They are charging employee and employer national insurance and charging for apprenticeship. This company is not interested in maxising my income. They are quite happy to dip their hands into my hard earned cash. Avoid them. Workwell did contact me to discuss my review. I am still not happy. They mentioned I was going to get paid £537 today which is in my account.  They have kept over £2000 of my money. This doesn't include pension. These agencies don't give you a choice on how you want to be paid. Its a SCAM!!!!!,1,Date of experience: 10 April 2024,Updated 12 Apr 2024

I tend to get a bit worried when it comes to taxes and money matters, so it's only natural I was anxious to get everything right. Also, turns out someone put me down as earning way more than I'm meant to (like over £100 an hour or something mental), so Jamal T is going to get the admin team to sort that out, and will give me either a phonecall or an email acting as confirmation that everything is okay.

Avoid. 4.5 Trust pilot review is a lie. 2 tops,"This company is the company that keeps giving….. headaches and stress. From the onset there has been issue after issue. Should have been a red flag from the start when I kept getting text messages telling me to complete my security clearance yet no email for security was ever received. The agency had to step in as workwell wouldn’t admit that they were sending to an incorrect email address and that it was my fault. Fast forward to week 4 of working with them. I have yet to have a correct wage or expenses paid. No point emailing or calling to speak to someone as all emails and calls go to a central call centre where you have to continually explain the issue to a new operator for them to disappear and leave you to start again from the beginning. The expense portal wasn’t allowing me to upload my receipts but it also won’t submit the details without uploading something. The operator told me to email the receipts and info direct. I did. Say operator ‘Deehska’ gets involved and says emailing receipts in isn’t allowed  and must be via the portal. I, as normal, explained what had happened and resent my receipts with all details required. Low and behold he taxed my expenses….. another few weeks past with the usual failed phone calls and emails. And my emails are probably verging on being rude as it’s becoming a joke, got all the details of the last 4 weeks together with all the info and emailed in as told to again to a specific email. Operator Deehska has returned and said that they have to be via the portal….. and now saying that I may of emailed in the details before but he wants the exact same details re-emailed in. I have requested my p45 and leaving this umbrella company as fast as humanly possible. Save yourself a lot of headaches and stress and go talk to a cat regarding your wages. The kicker is that they even charge you for this service. You honestly couldn’t make it up.",1,Date of experience: 19 February 2024,19 Feb 2024

Not recommended - read the review for details!,"An absolutely terrible company in my opinion. They automatically enhance you to the extra 'fee' you pay them (which gives you a 'priority' email address for fast-tracking support apparently, so they do discriminate for those who pay more).They also didn't refund me for the unwanted perk-payment per week and made errors in my tax-code resulting in lower pay than expected. They couldn't provide a reason why. National Insurance payments made looked a little fishy too.Customer support involves a 40-minute wait on the phone each time and nothing so far is resolved, only 'escalated'. No response at the time of posting.I'd recommend avoiding working with this company and anyone that works with them too. Have to add - on my payslip (in the long 'Workwell Margin and Costs' section is an 'Apprenticeship Levy' of £4.95). I have no idea what this is and can't seem to find out. Weird company.

The excuse they gave was that they took around £7 per week for a £55 weekly holiday accrual. This is over 10%.

I have no idea why people are praising someone called 'Jamal'.  I spoke with this person three evenings ago and was promised a follow-up call next day.  Two days later:  nothing.  I am very concerned about compliance with HMRC guidelines.  Will be escalating to HMRC.  The call-back feature is a joke - you are advised to press '2' and they will call you back automatically and you will not be charged for the call.  Of course you will not be charged because the call-back will never happen.  It is just a ruse to get you off the phone.  Support Staff do not complete their shifts and finish early.  My call this was ended at 19.45, yet they are supposed to offer support until 20.00.  Tried ringing back but was told their offices were closed - open until 8pm the recorded message advised.

"Slow, late filing, unreliable, hard to contact","Sadly I find the one star reviews on Trustpilot are more in line with my experience - the vague, short, 5 star reviews, many posted on the same day, seem suspicious to me.Anyway, my original accountant was great, they sold out to JSA which is when things started getting a little worse, but since Work ""well"" (haha) took over, service has fallen off a cliff.They do not easily respond to emails, and I've tried calling as well, they don't call back.  I needed something quite urgently for a client reference, and despite multiple requests, I didn't get an answer for a week - by which time I'd managed to fish out what I needed myself.  But good job I did find it, as I still don't believe they would have responded with the info by now.They filed my 2020 accounts late, for which I received a fine from companies house - they said that an appeal had been raised, but quite frankly I don't believe them.  I appealed myself after that, and had the fine removed.Because of this late filing, I especially asked for my next year accounts to be filed as soon as possible - which of course they didn't do, and were late again.  A £300 fine this time, again they said they're appealing.  I've been trying to chase up the status for 2 months, and still not heard anything back from Workwell on this.As a contractor my accounts are very basic, but I'm not an accountant so I need a trusted service to support me.  Unfortunately I can't recommend Workwell - unless you like sleepless nights and fines from the government.",1,Date of experience: 01 March 2023,28 Mar 2023

So I have to pay fees to get money i earned, WHY, BECAUSE THEY ARE TO WEAK TO GET THE PROPER RATE FROM THE CLIENT AND INSTEAD TAKE IT FROM THE WORKER!Absolute scam and a joke.I will be taking the Agency to court for misrepresentation as they never once mention this is how payment works.These Umbrella companies are for self employed people, not PAYE, a company that employees you should not be charging you to get your wages.THIS IS A SCAM, DONT BE FORCED TO USE THEM LIKE I WAS.

Appalling accountancy for LTD companies,"Appalling accountancy for my limited company. Started off okay in 2019 but has been getting slowly worse with 2022-2023 absolutely shocking.Takes months to respond to emails, ignore phones calls. Received penalties and interest on late HMRC submissions and payments because of their last minute approach - seemingly using different people each time fronted by my ""personal"" accountant, which is complete nonsense. He doesn't have a clue about my account, couldn't care less and can't even be bothered to construct a sentence properly when he does get in touch with me.It feels like they've outsourced the accountancy work to the lowest bidder behind the scenes with in-experienced accountants running around with little or no guidance whilst the company owners coin it in.Avoid these cowboys at all costs.",1,Date of experience: 02 March 2023,2 Mar 2023

I would not recommend this company,I would not recommend this company. I recently incurred expenses on a business trip which were beyond question non-taxable under HMRC guidelines. These 6expenses were paid out my own pocket and not through a company credit card. Workwell taxed these expenses and when questioned about they stated that they do not recognise the HMRC guidelines and in addition they have no obligation to recognise non-taxable expenses.,1,Date of experience: 28 November 2022,28 Nov 2022

We are now in June 2022. When I asked for the December payment, they told me that they paid me a week in June 2021 (yes this is a year ago!) by mistake. What mistake, I did work the week in June 2021. But they obviously don't care and are happy with their ridiculous excuse for non-payment. When I asked them to check their accounts to check if the end client paid them they told me that it's difficult. They are obviously completely incompetent.

No Reference letters,It is  standard from your accountant  - at least I thought so - when getting into a tenant agreement or applying for a mortgage.I am told 3 times now that such letter is not possible to get and I need to upload my dividends report from Freeagent. It does not say anything about me and looks not like a reference letter.I have now send sample letters in that the team can see what is needed and still hope somehow I can get a written accountancy reference. This is effecting my own reputation which I find incredible. Again staff are very helpful but process and customer centricity is lost here.

Avoid,"I recently left JSA (Workwell) as I couldn't take their continued lack of care and non-performance of duty.This practice was forced upon me due to my previous accountants being acquired. The previous accountants did have a few members of staff move over within the acquisition but they all left within a very short amount of time. The previous accountants were great, always informative, kept me up to date and completed all work within a respectable deadline for my company. As soon as JSA (Workwell) took over I quite simply became a statistic. They became uninterested in replying to emails in a decent timeline, my accounts and personal tax returns were all late and it was impossible to get a conversation out of their staff.One of the most worrying parts of all this is trying to understand the accountancy knowledge that this company actually has. I recently learnt that Workwell outsources a significant amount of their accounts and personal tax return work to companies overseas, something I find absolutely ridiculous considering my company could be managed by a trainee accountant with the small amounts of transactions.When they were informed I was moving accountant they didn't seem bothered in the slightest which further supports my comment amount being a statistic. Even the handover to my new adviser took almost a month and they only handed over about 5 documents, all of which should have already been saved in company folder. Workwell should be desperately looking to improve their processes in-house before acquiring more work they (and the overseas accountants) obviously can't handle.",1,Date of experience: 17 June 2022,17 Jun 2022

Very poor experience,"Very poor experience. I had an accountant for my limited company that was taken over by JSA (now Workwell), I not sure exactly when, but the original accountancy team was retain so I didn't notice a change. In the summer of last year (2021) I received notification that my accountancy service was to be passed to Head Office and a new accountant would be assigned. That didn't happen until nearly the end of the year. In the meantime I was trying to get my personal tax return completed and taking steps to close the company having completed my final contract and retiring. Since I did not have an assigned accountant, I was dealing with different people each time I enquired. There was no commitment to complete either task by any specific date, just we are working on it or it will be delivered soon.The first sign of trouble was to be informed, right after end of year accounts, that since the company held more than £25,000 I would need an official receiver and there would be extra costs. I was pretty annoyed at this, that they didn't bother to inform me and allow me to take some dividend to reduce the amount and obviate this need. Workwell did alter the filing date til later, allowing me to take a dividend, but there was still no commitment to getting the company wound up.The other task, my tax return was another issue. Again there was no commitment to getting it done. In January this year I made it clear that I didn't want it done at the last minute and again no commitment to any completion. Despite this and I believed the deadline was 31st Jan, it was sent through on the afternoon of the 31st, so no time to check and correct or approve. Apparently, an extension to end of Feb was available that I was not aware of, so luckily no fine.During this time of course my company was not trading and should only have been paying Workwell the Dormancy fee, not the full IR35 package that was being taken. I pointed this out and Workwell agreed to amend the payment and return the overpayment. That did not happen, the overpayment continued and there was no refund. At this point with the overpayments and no winding up completion in sight, I had enough and informed Workwell I was terminating out contract and not to take any more of the full package fees. To be sure, I cancelled the direct debit to I believed prevent the continued overcharging. I was then flabbergasted to discover that Workwell had somehow managed to set up a new direct debit for the full IR35 fee without my authorisation and continue to drain my company account. My bank told me that they didn't know how this could happen. I can only surmise that they used a copy of my signature. I'm not a legal expert, but I wonder if this can be considered fraudulent, maybe if a legal eagle is reading this they would like to comment. I ask the bank to stop any further payments. They have not to date made good the overpayment, therefore I have simply written it off.The good news is that I got a new accountant, ok it's cost me more, but it's worth not having the stress and annoyance of dealing with a company like Workwell. And what a contrast! My new accountant is pro-active, he's prepared all the docs and got my to sign them, given a time-line as to what happens and when, told how much corporation tax to pay for last year and for this, he even noticed that I had missed a payment to HMRC, all this in the space of a couple of weeks.The accounting is done through an online system called Freeagent, once I got full control of it I was looking through the various pages and settings. Under User I could see who had access, so I could remove previous accounts. There's a column for Last Logged In, get this, against my assigned account's name, it said Never Logged In, so my previous account had never even bothered to check anything! The word for that is I'm afraid, negligence.I'm just glad to be shot of this company and I write this so hopefully anyone who's accountancy company is taken over by Workwell, they won't just assume everything will continue in a satisfactory manner as I did.",1,Date of experience: 06 June 2022,6 Jun 2022

There are errors and we find ourselves having to get more and more involved in the accounts.  We have received a fine for late filing and incurred interest.  It is very difficult to get anyone from the firm to call us back.

Simply awful - AVOID!,"Was with Accountsnet which was always fine and efficient. Two acquisitions later, it's now Workwell and it's clear it's just a numbers game for them. Jack up prices, sign up as many customers as possible and cut back staff to the bone. Every deadline is missed or is provided for sign off and review at the last possible second with no chance to correct anything. Doesn't matter how simple the accounting or how far in advance you provide the information, they'll always leave it to the last minute. Emails are routinely ignored. Named accountants are perfectly nice if you phone up but powerless to do anything. They provide a locked down version of Freeagent which means you can't even fix issues yourself.

Avoid or escape ASAP if you're not with them by choice,"As a former customer of K&B, JSA (or whatever it's called this week) was unfortunately inflicted upon me when they bought the firm and essentially fired everybody as far as I could find out. When I got ""reassigned to the head office to be better served"" as the PR spin went the service quality (or lack thereof as you'll see shortly) dropped immediately and sharply.Every email is answered by a different person, even in the same thread, they keep asking for information that you have provided months ago, ""We will complete accounts as soon as possible"" apparently means ""three weeks and counting"", and they even try and charge you bogus late fees! It feels like they knew what they were doing: they were using terms like ""before a certain date"", once I managed to get a straight answer and an actual date it turned out to be well after I submitted everything, go figure.They say never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence, in which case I would suggest to find another accountancy that's actually competent (and cheaper!).

"Pensions, Apprenticship levy, Taxed on expenses","Point 1 Connie was very knowledgeable about product but I am still upset that I am being taxed for expenses that has already been taxed.  I guess this is something but I would consider a approach where your clients like me do not leave for 'other incumbents' that has not acknowledge the need for change.  I think JSA needs to be able to allow clients to logon and upload a spreadsheet or other formats which will allow you to present this to the HMRC at end of the tax year afterall you are managing our payrole and getting paid for the service.  Alternatively direct input of data that is required as proof.  Without this, change will make it a messy situation and can only lead to clients like myself loosing out on what they have already paid tax for.Point 2 Smart pensions is a great thing though and Connie politely helped me understand the change here.Point 3 I am not happy bout this - apprenticeship levy  - another stealth tax on the poor.  It does not help when we are on a lower wage than many contractors.Overall some of the points are mandatory changes and are required by other powers but we should have some notification as to what is changing.

Do not use JSA.  Utter rubbish.,"Yet another JSA customer with an awful experience and accounts filed late. Since my brilliant accountants, Accountsnet were bought by JSA the service has got worse and worse and the monthly costs have gone up.Currently, despite having provided all necessary information in a very timely manner, they have missed my final filing date with Companies House.  They didn't even start the accounts until they were overdue and I chased. I now face a fine, which they have not undertaken to cover, and still after the overdue notice 14 day period the accounts are still far from correct; riddled with errors.  My company faces being deregistered through no fault of my own.JSA have not apologised or undertaken to cover the penalty costs. I have asked them to escalate my complaint, but nobody takes it seriously.  They just ask for more information and kick the can down the road.They also got my VAT wrong, treating an interest payment as a VAT'able sale when I have had no other sales in that year.They have also not started my SATR yet. They will probably reply below, apologising for ""Any Inconvenience""  With this lot, the inconvenience is nailed on, completely obvious to anyone who cares to look, but they just don't care.",1,Date of experience: 15 February 2022,15 Feb 2022
Pick another accountancy company - do not sign up.,"I'm a contractor and very rarely have queries, all i need is my VAT submitted and tax amounts calculated.  They got my personal income tax amount wrong (by a long way) and feels like you have to constantly chase them to get a response for basic  questions on email.  I have been with them 5 years now and it was ok to start with but recently it's gone downhill and it seems they are at the bottom of it now.You might want to look around a bit first as I'm sure there are much better firms out there.They did call me after posting this review to say they are trying to get better but that sort of thing doesn't happen overnight.***Just to update I have now changed accountants, please do yourself a favour and steer clear of this company, they are hopeless.",1,Date of experience: 15 February 2022,Updated 14 Jul 2022

He is always available with well researched and thoughtful advice and nothing is ever too much work. He is a knowledgeable senior accountant, but never hesitates to make use of JSA’s many specialists when relevant (not least their great IR35 team) to qualify any replies he gives to insure the best service possible.

"Disappointing service, I would not recommend them.","*** JSA completed my SATR on 23/02/2022.  I was charged £5.84 interest for late payment on account by the HMRC.  I am glad that I wasn't fined more, but this should never have happened.  I gave JSA all the information they needed on 26/11/2021 to complete my SATR. They caused me unnecessary stress.  Giving them 2 stars instead of 1, as Donna and Dawn did return my calls so I wasn't ignored.** Update. Spoke to Donna who is the manager of my personal accountant Dawn.  I was told they would update me today (22/02/2022), but nothing. I still don't know if they will finish my SATR before 28/02/2022.  That means I may be charged £100 by the HMRC for late filing. Absolutely disgraceful service.  *Update.  My self-assessment tax return for 2021 is still not ready.  I chased for an update today (18/02/2022) and they told me it would be ready by 24/02/2022.  I wonder if JSA has missed the SATR deadline of 31/01/2022 for anyone else or is it just me? Very disappointing service...I have employed JSA Services to complete my self-assessment tax return for 2020-2021.  Having my own full time job, 2 kids and moving home I thought it would be easier to have my accountant submit it.  Not wanting to miss the SATR deadline, I sent all my information to JSA on 26/11/2021.  I sent a few email chasers in January to find out when my SATR would be ready.  I was initially told it would be done before 31/01/2022.  I wasn't too worried so I waited.  A few days before the deadline I asked again about my SATR and I was still told it would be ready by 31/01/2022.  I called up on Friday (28/01/2022) about it and this time I was told that JSA would work through the weekend to have it completed.  I thought this was strange as I sent my information back in 26/11/2021.  Fair enough I thought, my accountant told me about delays due to Covid.  Not surprisingly, on 31/01/2022 I received an email telling me that my SATR would not be completed in time and my accountant expressed that the HMRC deadline was extended to 28/02/2022.  I finally received my SATR on 03/02/2022.  Due to my own work commitments (also affected by Covid), 2 kids and house move I only finished reviewing my SATR today (11/02/2022) and I am disappointed that they missed so many items.  Over 2 months and JSA did not once request any additional information from me and I had to spend hours of my own time reviewing it.  Hopefully JSA will get my SATR finished soon so I won’t be charged too much interest on the late payment. And this isn't my first disappointing encounter with JSA.  I recently closed my Ltd company and JSA were delayed in completing my cessation accounts, but that's another story which they did resolve quickly when I complained.  And don't mention when JSA took over CleverAccounts and messed up my accounting data.",2,Date of experience: 11 February 2022,Updated 4 Mar 2022

Terrible unprofessional umbrella company with non-facing payroll service,"Terrible customer service I want to share my experience for anyone who is considering choosing an umbrella company.  DO NOT choose JSA Group. I am experiencing so many issue trying to get my P45 I left a role on the 20/01/22, JSA payroll cut-off date was the 31/01/22. I have just been informed that they will not be issuing my P45 until the 01/03/2022 because they are processing the payslips at the end of each month and they have not done it for January, meaning it won't be done until the end of February.  Initially I was told that they could not process my P45 because my January payment is paid in February that means I am still employed with them.I explained I gave you notice on the 30/12/2021 that I was leaving the role I was in on the 20/01/2022 to start a new role with another company on the 25/01/2022 and needed a P45 asap. They told me my P45 would be issued when they processed my last payment to ensure the correct figures were on my P45.  However, this did not happen.  They processed my payslip, they did not put in the system that I have left and no P45 was generated. JSA still have me in the system as active (as an employee) even though I gave them notice on the 30/12/21. They told me because I am still an employee my leaving date will now be the 28/02/22, i told her this is not correct because my leaving date at my previous role was the 20/01/22 and I started a new role. Because of JSA in-action HMRC has given me an emergency tax code. JSA told me payroll is not customer-facing and that's a big issue if you are using an umbrella company.I would recommend that you avoid using this company, i spoke to two operative and the situation is still unresolved.  One is Anisa B and the other was her Manager.",1,Date of experience: 10 February 2022,10 Feb 2022

This means their prices have double in 3 years! That's a very scary rate of increase.I tired to call them about this but, every time I tried to call, I would be 17-18th in place on a queue!Even after requesting a call back it would take 2-3 hours for them to call me back!

I agreed a margin with them then was charged a margin £5 higher. When I did final get a response when I challenged this one person said no problem they’d sorted it, then I got another email from someone else claiming the agreement was for a different assignment so the higher margin was correct.

They shouldn't be trading,Like others in the reviews section I've been with a previous firm who jsa acquired. They were great but jsa have left me with letters and fines from HMRC for missed deadlines. I've been waiting for company final accounts to be done for over a year now with new dates and promises every time I call or email. The advice one company expenses is not clear. I have documents showing I can claim certain expenses and even emails saying what percentage is deemed acceptable and then years later they change their mind retroactively and want me to repay the company those amounts which are thousands of pounds. I've asked them to tell me what they now deem acceptable expenses but they just won't tell me. It's shocking. I've decided to report them as a company as I don't believe anyone should pay for a service like this. Initially to fsca but I'd be happy to try taking them to court if that route fails to get any traction. Avoid avoid avoid,1,Date of experience: 22 December 2021,22 Dec 2021

JSA have ruined a great Accountancy Firm in such a short period of time,"I've been contracting for 11 years and since JSA took over K&B Accountancy Group, it's destroyed an amazing company in a matter of months.  K&B accountants and admin, specially Catherine, were always extremely responsive, nothing was too much trouble, communication was excellent.  Now JSA have appalling customer service, their ""personal accountants"" promise they will come back to you but you never get a response.  I've been waiting over 7 weeks for a very simple annual tax return to be completed with no response and no follow-up.  I can understand why so many of the previous staff have left with such poor new leadership having taken over.",1,Date of experience: 09 December 2021,Updated 27 Aug 2024

They give no information about when will they complete this.They could know that they will not able to complete year-ending but they didn't do it just for collecting as much as money they can. I had also received letters from HMRC because of missing or invalid payrolls data, the amounts I see on FreeAgent, the amount I should pay according to them and on HMRC letters don't match, and they have no idea about this at all.I guess they victimised a lot of companies with such service.

This is a shocking organisation and the…,"This is my final post as i have had enough of JSA and while they mige like to try rebranding their behaviour continues to be shocking to the end. See below my lastest email to them, based on their refusal to issue a P45...Dear sir/madamThis is totally unacceptable and as per your usual behaviour smacks of gross incompetence. I left during the tax year ending 2021/22 (31/03/22) and you ran the P45 during the tax year ending 2021/22 (04/04/22), you confirmed that these dates meant I would get a P45 and not a P60 and I have that in writing from JSA.Yet again as you have shown continually throughout the time i have unfortunately had to use your services you have shown what a poorly managed and incompetent company you are. You might like to think a rebranding will improve your image but that is clearly not going to happen.UPDATE - This company are now attempting to start deducting Income tax and national insurance from billable expenses, without providing any proof that a HMRC notice has been issued that this is the correct treatment for billiable expenses. This is another attempt to rip ""employees"" off under the guise of adherence to their accrediation company FCSA, despite the fact that other umbrella companies have no knowledge of this. Do not touch JSA you will regret it if your doThis is a shocking organisation and the experience with them has put me off using umbrella companies. They try and fob you off with excuses, pass the file from person to person, fail to respond within 8hrs and fail to respond when they are supposed to. They deliver what they think they should not what is in the Contract of Employment and use everything they can to not do what is correct according to various guidelines and processes. Be very careful in using this company as i certainly would not recommend them.In response to the reply from JSA this just shows how poor they are as they have been in contact by phone and email and refused to acknowledge there is an issue let alone do anything about it. They have taken hundreds of pounds from me which they know needs to be refunded but are refusing to do so.To update this further, just to show how poor this organisation is. They deducted Pension contributuions from me when i had already told them i was in a workplace pension, which The Pension Regulator confirmed meant i didnt have to join another Workplace pension. The money was taken at the beginning of November and in order to prevent me from opting out they have thus far refused to send the file to the pension company, therefore keeping the money taken, claiming it will be sent ""next week"" (6th December week). I have told them to stop taking any further money as i intend to opt out, but they are refusing, therefore they are now going to take hundreds of more pounds from me that i am not going to be able to get back until January/February 2022, due to the delay's in JSA submitting my details. Really cant be trusted as a business, definately do not touch.04/12/2021 - Next Update as at today they have failed to pay despite my salary being due for payment on the 4th in line with the date i was paid last month, and on response to my email chase has been received.",1,Date of experience: 16 November 2021,Updated 7 Apr 2022

Have your limited company without the worry about accountancy.,"I went freelance almost 2 years ago, JSA was recommended to me, the whole process of starting a company was really painless, a couple of emails back and forth (verification of ID, signing of documents) and a phone call was all that was necessary for my company to be setup. JSA provides freeagent as their admin platform. I have my starling account mapped to freeagent and so everything works nicely together. With the mobile phone app of freeagent on my phone I can add the receipts straight onto the expenditures.All the accountancy stuff that you normal have to worry about they take care off with most of the work that you have to do (assuming you record your expenses and receipts) is sign off on the yearly reports and transfer the money to HMRC.As an additional service you can buy their yearly personal tax service, which I highly recommend so that everything ties in neatly together.There maybe other accountant out there, they may even be cheaper, but I will stick with JSA because it just works for me, they have demonstrated to me to be highly competent and easy to work with. The 217.20 GBP I pay monthly is in my opinion really good value for money, they have lower tiers available but I opted for the higher values and the extra membership to IPSE  which is another organisation that covers things like IR35 insurance.I would say highly recommended!",5,Date of experience: 18 October 2021,18 Oct 2021

HMRC fined me £100 and took the payment from a refund, and there is a £150 fine (plus interest) outstanding now with Companies house.  JSA claim they will refund any penalties if their appeal is unsuccessful, but until then, it's tough luck.  Of course, if they decide not to there is no reasonable recourse, and yet they still demand their monthly fees. To be entirely frank, I couldn’t care less about the £250 fines; it’s neither here nor there in the grand scheme of things.

Worst accountancy firm ever!,"I own three companies that had their accounts taken over by JSA from my previous accountancy form AccountsNet (who always for the record gave excellent service) as result of a buy out.All three of my 2019-2020 company accounts had their data entered into an online portal and were ready for finalising at the end of August 2020.  To date the first of my company accounts for 2019-2020 has only just been dealt with by JSA despite over a year of email and telephone exchanges and even when they were completed had errors and required several pushbacks before they were correct.The second company account details were essentially lost and so I am current in the process (after a email a month or so ago) of putting together all the relevant data again, which you can appreciate is very time consumning when trying to run a business out of Covid.As for the accounts of my third company, I have STILL heard nothing back despite again asking for over 12 months for resolution and being told ""they are starting work on them soon"".All three companies are currently in the process of being fined by companies house because of late accounts and purely down to JSA poor service and delays.On the rate occasions I do manage to get though on the phone to JSA, the person on the end of the phone usually talks in a strong Asian (sounds Chinese) accent and is completely unable to be understood.  I can only assume this is due to offshoring the call centre staff.The overall experience since JSA taking over from AccountsNet mid 2020 has been the worst customer service I have experienced from any, company ever...never mind a ""Professional"" accountancy firm.

"Poor communication, not paid at all","With IR35 initially being introduced in April 2020, I did my research and registered with JSA Group. I explained that I am a vet locum who moves around different practices and can be in up to 4 different sites in 1 week for different/same company. This was explained in the initial discussion, I registered with JSA Group after looking at my other options and then the corporate practices have carried out due diligence and approved JSA group for me to use when doing work for them. Due to the delay of IR35 I have not started using their services until this April 2021, so I have submitted my weekly time sheets via email. I had multiple phone conversations with JSA Group about billing the different sites of the one corporate. So when I was not paid at the end of April, I contacted JSA twice in May's first week to ask why. The invoices were not paid as they could not write the correct details for the billing and submit a separate invoice for each site worked.  It was discovered by JSA Group that they could not do this back in December 2020 and informed the corporate but neglected to inform me at any time (no email, no update when I called multiple times to try and sort out arranging invoices!) The fact that JSA Group's final email to me was effectively sacking me by 'closing my account and sending me a P45' was also not very professional, with no apologises about anything.Poor communication and wasting my time has meant that I am not happy to recommend JSA Group to anyone, as I am now still not paid and having to scrabble to find an alternative.",1,Date of experience: 10 May 2021,10 May 2021

I had problems logging into the system to raise a timesheet (although I did end up emailing them directly twice, so at least it got through), I submitted expenses that weren't charged back to the client until I chased. Despite me requesting not to be in the pension scheme, they withdrew that (and ultimately reimbursed me). And finally and this may be too specific, I was raising invoices monthly, the client paid one late 27th and 30th, but instead of waiting a day and paying them in 2 months, they paid one then updated the payslip to pay both in one month, meaning I was on higher rate for the entire 2nd month and I'll need to mess around with HMRC at year end to get my higher rate payment back.

I can only recommend JSA, I will continue using their services at a personnal level and will certainly trust them again in the future if I'm back to contracting.",5,Date of experience: 04 January 2021,4 Jan 2021

Consistently Good Service,"I have always found JSA to be responsive and helpful when I ask questions which have, being relatively new to the contractor market, been numerous.  In particular, the support I have received from Kirsty Thomas has been exceptional and I would like to thank her for her considerable patience.",5,Date of experience: 21 December 2020,21 Dec 2020
Hannah Kuzik and JSA,"Hannah Kuzik has been my Personal Accountant for almost 4 years now and I have found Hannah's support to be superb. Nothing is ever too much trouble and all queries are answered professionally, promptly and intelligently. I would have no hesitation in recommending Hannah and JSA, as I have found both Hannah and the wider organisation to be of a very good quality, giving me peace of mind in my business.",5,Date of experience: 18 December 2020,18 Dec 2020
Think before joining JSA group,"I have been with my Accountant for last 5 years and had good experience. Unfortunately my Accountant merged with JSA group and after it has been such an horrible experience. Preparing accounts is taking ages and no response from them. On sending repeated emails, I was provided with their HMRC agent login and password details on email. Not sure if they deserve to be accountants. Think before joining themUpdate on 27-April-2021Got my Final Accounts prepared last week after several followups. But still it hasn't been filled. Not sure what they are waiting for. Earlier last 3 weeks I was told that accounts were ready but are reviewed by a Senior Accountant. I had told them about reclaiming S455 tax last year. They said it has been done by post in beginning of March. Today on calling HMRC helpline, I was informed that they didn't receive any such application. JSA doesn't have any reference to the reclaim application that was done by post. As usual email to them has no response. Since they have no reference from HMRC or proof of postage it means they are making a false statement.",1,Date of experience: 17 December 2020,Updated 27 Apr 2021
JSA Services,"I’ve recently been in touch with Kwasi and Natalie at JSA and although I’m not one to typically write reviews I had to come express my thanks for the service they’ve provided me.JSA have recently taken over Liberty Bishop and what a difference they’ve made.  Over the past few days JSA (Kwasi and Natalie) have supported me, helped me and even re-arranged time and workload for my support when in fact I am an ex-employee of Liberty Bishop I can’t thank these two people enough as they both went the extra mile.If anyone out there is thinking of using an umbrella company or needs accountancy or payroll services then this is the team to approach. They’re professional, courteous and will help every step of the way.Thank you to the JSA team, I will certainly not hesitate to recommend your servicesMark",5,Date of experience: 17 December 2020,17 Dec 2020
Great service from Maria & co,Great service from Maria & co. I was reccomended to Maria by my agency and I must say i was sceptical at the start as you read loads of horror stories on umbrellas but they have been fantastic from the word go. The service levels are great & especially during COVID. Keep up the good work!,5,Date of experience: 16 December 2020,Updated 16 Dec 2020
Over 20 years great service,I've recently closed down my Ltd Company due to retirement and would like to pass on my thanks to JSA for over 20 years of great service (most recently Paavan's team). From company start up through to closure they've always been very efficient. They've always adopted the latest technology which in turn reduced my quarterly accounting time from half a day to less than an hour.Highly recommended.,5,Date of experience: 16 December 2020,16 Dec 2020

JSA - Natalie and Caroline,"I have worked with Natalie & Caroline at JSA for over 5 years now. Put simply, I won't ever feel the need to go to anyone else for support with payroll as my experience with both ladies has been brilliant from day 1. Very professional, incredibly quick to reply regardless of day/time which is so crucial in our line of work and lastly, great to work with. Highly recommend both Natalie and Caroline personally and JSA as a company.",5,Date of experience: 16 December 2020,16 Dec 2020

Been a customer for 8 years.. Basic service. Poor communication and lack of responsibility,"Been a customer for 8 years, I can't think of a single time I was happy with their service or skills. Poor communication. Zero personal service. They just do the basics, but poorly.  Dates set and promised by JSA don't mean anything.. when missed they just give excuses .. customer service and expertise in business is very limited. When issues are escalated, you just get more excuses.  When asking a question or try to contact your account manager (which changed constantly), they always have to get back to you.. but they never do. You have to constantly chase. When HMRC deadlines get close, they contact you with just days notice and put the pressure on YOU to do it on time. Then constant blame everyone else but themselves for the delays. Not proactive at all. Emails are generic. Sometimes is hard to know if you're being emailed by a person or a robot.It's a bare basic service which doesn't warrant the fees.",1,Date of experience: 04 December 2020,4 Dec 2020
