## ‚≠ê Trustpilot Review Scraper

This project is a bot designed to scrape public reviews from Trustpilot for a certain company. It uses an undetected Chrome driver to avoid bot detection and extracts review titles, descriptions, ratings, review dates, and experience dates from multiple pages. All the collected data is saved to a CSV file for analysis or record-keeping.
